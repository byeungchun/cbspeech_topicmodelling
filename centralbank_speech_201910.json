        "title": "Olli Rehn: Next steps towards a stronger monetary union",
        "content": "Accompanying slides of the speech.\\nRt. Hon. Members of Parliament, Ladies and Gentlemen,\\nIt is a great pleasure to discuss these most relevant topics of EMU reform with a most knowledgeable audience, among old and new friends.\\nSince 2013, economic growth has continued in the euro area, and the unemployment rate has been on a downward trend. This is most welcome.\\nHowever, we have major challenges of the short term and longer term now. The first ones relate to the current economic downturn, the latter to the unfinished business of the Economic and Monetary Union. Let me discuss these challenges one after another.\\n1. For some time by now, the world economy has been going through a downswing led by the deceleration in world trade and industrial production. That's why the Governing Council of the European Central Bank decided two weeks ago on a monetary policy package that consists of mutually reinforcing elements. It aims to ensure that financial conditions remain favourable to firms and households, so that they support sustained growth and the sustained convergence of inflation to our medium-term inflation aim. However, as rightly pointed out by President Mario Draghi, these substantial monetary policy measures are leveraged best when also the other economic policy areas support euro area growth. Monetary policy cannot be the only active player in the field.\\nIn recent years, especially as the low interest rate environment and the effective lower bound have been constraining monetary policy, more and more attention has been put on fiscal policy and its capacity to help revitalise the economies that are suffering from subdued growth that is clearly below potential. It is evident that the role of fiscal policy is stronger when the effective lower bound is binding. This calls for a better balanced policy mix in the Eurozone than is the case today.\\nPolicy mix does matter for both the short-term and longer-term. Even though cyclical fluctuations refer to temporary movements, their effects may persist for a long time. For instance, a cyclical rise in unemployment may have long-lasting effects, especially if the labour market institutions do not support the unemployed in regaining work. While an effective, coordinated use of fiscal and monetary policies can provide a sound counter-cyclical response and thus dampen detrimental economic fluctuations, it can also support the conditions for longer-term economic well-being, social inclusion and sustained employment.\\nToday, the euro area member states have very different fiscal positions: some do have fiscal space, while others really don't. Moreover, the surplus economies would, when facing a recession, benefit from boosting domestic investment, not least in the digital infrastructure that is critical for Europe's economic revival. This would support economic activity across the euro area, as advised by the European Commission and the IMF.\\nAll this calls for better policy coordination for the sake of smooth rebalancing of the euro area than so far. In my view the Eurogroup could use the Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure more effectively, in order to provide us with better coordinated economic and fiscal policies across the Member States, to the overall benefit of the euro area.\\nMonetary policy is conducted currently in a challenging environment with vast uncertainties about the economic outlook. Furthermore, there are also new uncertainties and possibly fundamental changes in the functioning of the economy. Low interest rates, low inflation and persistently low growth put our economic theories and past empirical relationships into a real test. Facing these new challenges, it is sensible that the ECB should conduct a strategy review of our monetary policy frameworks. It will offer us an opportunity to conduct a thorough scientific assessment of our monetary policy framework and to evaluate its effectiveness in the light of the new economic landscape and new monetary policy instruments. \\n2. Furthermore, turning to the medium-to-longer term, we should not turn complacent and think that the monetary union is completed. It isn't. It is perhaps fair to say that since the year 2014 no major reforms have been made to strengthen the euro area architecture, unfortunately. Yet, sooner or later, we will again face more difficult times in the economy, and especially then, a strong monetary union will be very much needed.\\nFrom a central bank's standpoint the need to have a strong monetary union is evident. The primary objective of the Eurosystem is to maintain price stability. This may not be possible, if economic shocks tend to cripple the financial system and easily lead to severe problems in public finances. Effective countercyclical policies would then also be hampered.\\nFrom the point of view of my native Finland, a strong and resilient monetary union is very much needed. Finland is a relatively small and relatively open economy, and thus very much dependent on the health of the European economy. This goes for the other Member States as well. Every EU member state is a small state in the global context - the only difference is that some have already realised it, while others not.\\nSo how to make the monetary union stronger and more resilient? In my view, we need both risk reduction and risk sharing - a synthesis of these.\\nCompleting the Banking Union would be an important step in securing trust in the liquidity and solvency of euro area banks. It would reduce the probability of crises that threaten the stability of the banking system both in individual Member States and in the euro area as a whole.\\nIn push to break the bank-sovereign doom loop, the Banking Union has been a major improvement - even if it is still incomplete. It has reduced the threat of the banking system causing severe problems for sovereigns.\\nBut when considering the other side of the doom loop, less progress has been made. Problems in the financing of individual sovereigns could still have serious consequences for banks. In some cases, the concentration of sovereign debt in the books of domestic banks is high.\\nReducing this concentration would as such weaken the doom loop. At the same time it could help breaking the deadlock on building the European Deposit Insurance Scheme.\\nFurthermore, the creation of a European safe asset could help in weakening the bank-sovereign doom loop. Banks could hold the safe asset instead of domestic government debt. Any flight to safety in a crisis would take place between the safe asset and a more junior tranche - rather than between the bonds issued by different Member States.\\nA well-designed European safe asset could also help in fostering the Capital Markets Union. If a common safe asset existed, it would be possible to price newly issued securities against it. Deep capital markets require an abundance of risk-free assets as their backbone. And all this would be essential for a stronger global role of the euro in future.\\nOne measure that could be introduced relatively quickly is to boost the growth of the European market for green bonds. It is already the largest green bond market in the world, and the demand for such bonds is significant. Governments and the EU could facilitate the growth of this market. There is currently work ongoing to develop an EU taxonomy to define what is 'green'. It has been suggested that an EU standard for green bonds could build on this taxonomy.\\nYet another measure I would bring forward to promote the Capital Markets Union concerns activating retail investors, that is, SMEs and households. Currently, their participation in capital markets is lower than in the United States. It is restrained by a wide range of barriers. Offering different investment products to retail investors could be made easier. Retail investment regulation could be harmonised and simplified. Overlaps and inconsistencies across Member States could be removed.\\nFinally, regarding the Capital Markets Union, would it be useful to change the narrative attached to it? Perhaps the project would benefit from a new concept. \"Growth and Investment Union\", for instance, might provide a more positive perspective for the project.\\nLadies & Gentlemen,\\nTo sum up, we have major challenges to make the Economic and Monetary Union both more resilient and better able to deliver sustained growth and full employment. That is indeed our common challenge, so let's focus today on these challenges that really matter to our citizens - which is the only valid yardstick when considering our policy choices.\\nLooking forward to the discussion and many thanks for your attention!"

        "content": "Good morning. I would like to thank Georgetown University Law Center and the conference organizers, Anna Gelpern and Adam Levitin, for the opportunity to speak to you.\\nI was particularly delighted to be asked to speak at today's conference because the topic is law and macroeconomics, a field that my experience has persuaded me is of the first importance, but ill understood, and surprisingly understudied. Now, this may at first blush sound like a beloved former president, venturing into a grocery store-\"Golly, can you believe these scanners!?\"-because the field of law and economics was already sturdily established when I was in law school back in the Coolidge Administration, and is now well over half a century old. It has been the source of some of the most innovative and influential legal scholarship over the lifetimes of everyone here, and in many ways the insights of the law and economics movement have become the default framework that policy makers and practitioners alike use when we think about the law conceptually, and often even at the level of granular application."

        "title": "Benjamin E Diokno: The Philippine economy - sustaining resilience through transformational reforms",
        "content": "Mr. Tony Shale, Euromoney executives, colleagues in government, stakeholders from the private sector, ladies and gentlemen, good morning.\\nI would like to thank Euromoney for inviting me once again to the annual Philippines Investment Forum. Last year, I addressed the audience as Budget Secretary, and I am happy to speak once again, this time as Governor of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas.\\nToday, I will update you on the Philippine economy through the BSP lens and highlight the favourable performance of the Philippine economy amid external headwinds, aided by a long list of structural reforms that have transformed it into one of the most resilient economies in the region and the world.\\nA summary of basic macroeconomic figures supports the message that the Philippines is on a very sound footing.\\nEconomic growth is solid and sustainable. Inflation is manageable.\\nExternal payments position is comfortable. And, the banking system is strong and stable.\\nI will expound on each of these four points shortly.\\nThe Philippines has come a long way from being \"Asia's sick man.\" In fact, today the Philippines is recognized globally as among the fastest growing and most resilient economies in the world that enjoys even brighter prospects ahead.\\nThe transformation, of course, did not happen overnight. It was gradual and was a product of a long list of structural reforms that started way back in the 1990s.\\nI remember in the 1990s, a group of economist headed by Paul Krugman came to the Philippines and their verdict, the long term growth of the Philippines is at best 3 per cent. We've come a long way from there. For instance, we have deregulated oil industry, liberalized the power sector, privatized the water services, and accession to the World Trade Organization-just to name a few-are some of the reforms in the 1990s that have been followed through in the succeeding decades and-if I may stress-more aggressively so in the last three years. \\nVital reforms from 2016 onwards are expected to unleash more growth potentials for the Philippines. Among these positive game changers are tax reforms, liberalization of rice importation, the national ID system, Universal Healthcare, Universal Access to Tertiary Education, Ease of Doing Business law, relaxation of the Foreign Investments Negative List (FINL), and the revised Corporation Code-just to name a few.\\nAs far as the BSP is concerned, the newly amended Charter has strengthened the BSP's capacity to better safeguard price and financial stability, and to promote an efficient payments and settlements system and public services act, among others.\\nAt the moment, the Philippines is on the verge of becoming an upper middle-income economy. And with the continued reform momentum, we are paving the way to become a high-income status economy by 2040.\\nNow, let me to go back and expound on each of the four points I mentioned earlier.\\nFirst, solid and sustainable economic growth. As of the second quarter of 2019, the Philippines recorded its 82nd consecutive quarter of uninterrupted economic growth. This shows we have managed to sail through even the toughest external challenges from the Asian financial crisis to the Global financial crisis.\\nOur projection is for the Philippines to continue growing. This is consistent with the lofty goal of becoming a high-income economy in about two decades.\\nIn particular, the incremental capital-output ratio has been on a steady decline, dropping from 9.5 percent in 1992 to just 3.9 percent today.\\nIn addition, the economy's total factor productivity has increased, from only half a percent in the 1990s to about 2.0 percent today. These numbers mean that we are now able to produce more goods and services with the same amount of input-thanks to the long list of structural reforms we have implemented in the past.\\nAnd with the Build, Build, Build program ushering in the country's Golden Age of Infrastructure, we have additional solid push for the economy's productive capacity to expand further.\\nAt present, the Philippine economy's potential growth is estimated at 6.5 percent, more than twice what it was in the early 1990s. The potential growth is projected to rise even further in the next three years, matching the government's growth target of 7 to 8 percent by 2022.\\nThe ability of the government to invest more for the country's future is well supported by a healthy fiscal situation.  The budget deficit and the public debt are both manageable.\\nIn fact, despite the government's massive infrastructure investment, debt is sustainable, as reflected by low and declining debt-to-GDP ratio.\\nThe Philippines also enjoys improving labor dynamics, with the labor force becoming more educated. This bodes well for attracting more investments that generate higher paying jobs.\\nThis means our economy can grow at a much faster pace than decades ago-thereby unlocking more opportunities to pull more people out of poverty - without the risk of stoking up inflation. Without such risk, strong economic growth can be sustained over the long haul.  \\nSecond, within-target inflation. After being elevated last year due to supply-side factors, inflation has reverted to within the target range of 2 to 4 percent.\\nThis is credited to a series of monetary actions by the BSP that addressed brewing second-round effects combined with and non-monetary actions by the government that addressed bottlenecks to food supply.\\nWith the BSP's amended charter, we will ensure that we maximize its provisions to better fulfill our core mandate of price stability. Under the new Charter, the BSP is now allowed to issue its own debt instruments. Being able to issue our own debt instruments allows us to better manage liquidity in the system.\\nWith my appointment to the BSP last March coming shortly after the signing into law of the BSP's amended charter - a legislative reform that was decades in the making - I consider it my primary duty to ensure not just its implementation but also the maximization of its provisions for the benefit of the economy and the Filipino people.\\nThird, comfortable external payments position. Based on the latest estimates, the country is expected to post a US$3.7 billion surplus in its balance of payments this year. Thanks to solid foreign exchange inflows in the capital and financial account, the deficit in the current account is more than adequately covered.\\nTalking about the current account deficit, this is not something out of the ordinary, especially for a growing economy like ours that is investing vigorously in its future through an aggressive public infrastructure drive.\\nWith rising public and private investments, importation of rawer materials, intermediate goods, and capital equipment has also been growing. This explains the current account deficit, which nevertheless, is financeable, given robust foreign exchange inflows in the financial and capital account.\\nDriving the country's BOP surplus are reliable inflows of Overseas Filipinos' remittances, business process outsourcing (BPO) revenues, and tourism receipts. \\nTogether, the combined amount of these three was equivalent to 17 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) last year, up from 15 percent in 2010.\\nForeign direct investments (FDIs), roughly US$10 billion annually in the last 2 years, also lend support to the country's external account amid rising investor confidence.\\nThese steady inflows of foreign exchange have built ample gross international reserves (GIR) to an all-time high of US$86 billion.\\nAs of end-August 2019, the GIR could cover 7.5 months' worth of imports of goods and payments of services and primary income.  It was 5.5 times the country's short-term external debt based on original maturity and 4.0 times based on residual maturity.\\nThe latest GIR exceeding the outstanding external debt of US$81.3 billion. \\nAlso, external debt as a percent of GDP had dropped to only 23.8 percent as of the second quarter of 2019 from 60 percent in 2005.\\nOn to my fourth point which is a strong and stable banking system. Needless to say that the country's banking sector continues to serve as a stable anchor for the economy. It is sufficiently capitalized, with the capital adequacy ratio (CAR) standing at 15.9 percent in June 2019 on a consolidated basis compared with the BSP's regulatory minimum requirement of 10 percent and the international standard of 8.0 percent.\\nThe industry also enjoys low exposure to bad debts, with the non-performing loans ratio at a mere 1.6 percent as of end-July this year.\\nThe industry likewise exhibits robust lending activity, with credit helping boost not only household consumption but also business activities, such as real estate, trade, manufacturing, and construction, among other sectors.\\nIn addition, with BSP's strengthened capability to supervise the financial system, we are also able to supervise money service businesses, credit granting businesses, and payment system operators.\\nMoving forward, we will be even more proactive in promoting a regulatory environment that enables growth and innovation among banks but at the same time enhances their ability to manage risks-all with the Filipino people in mind.\\nThese developments and prospects are all recognized by relevant international observers. In fact, international credit rating agencies further upgraded our credit ratings after giving us the minimum investment grades in 2013.\\nWe are currently rated one notch above the minimum investment grade by Fitch and Moody's, while we are just a step away from securing a Single-A rating from S&P Global. We are keen on hitting the minimum rating within the A territory over the next two years or so.\\nOf course, higher credit ratings are not an end goal in themselves. It is also a means to generate greater benefits for Filipinos through translating economic growth to actual poverty reduction.\\nWith higher credit ratings, interest rates on government borrowings drop, which leads to savings on interest payments and, therefore, more fiscal space to fund infrastructure projects and social services.\\nSecuring higher credit ratings requires the Philippines to post even better numbers on various metrics on the economy, parallel to those exhibited by higher rated and richer economies.\\nAs such, aiming for A ratings goes hand in hand with the goal for the Philippines to graduate into an upper middle income economy over the short term and to a high income economy over the long haul.\\nThen again, this is something no institution can singlehandedly accomplish. This requires concerted effort among all concerned institutions, public and private.\\nAs Governor of the BSP, my personal aim is to bring BSP closer to the people. The primary means to do so is to vigorously pursue initiatives geared toward greater financial inclusion. We believe that with easier access to financial products and services, people are accorded more opportunities to pursue savings, investments, and entrepreneurial activities that help augment incomes.\\nWe are doing this through the following (1) financial technology, (2) financial education, and (3) capital market development.\\nOn financial technology, the BSP continues to enable a regulatory environment supportive of the development of financial technology (fintech), while at the same time ensuring strengthened relevant risk governance and consumer protection systems.\\nWe want to advance the country's digital financial ecosystem in such a way that every individual is able to open a deposit account and use digital financial services through simplified requirements and interoperable payment systems.\\nUnder the BSP's National Retail Payment System (NRPS) framework, we have started implementation of the two interoperable payments systems, particularly the InstaPay for low value payments settled in real time and the PESONet for bigger amounts of payments settled typically within the same banking day. \\nAs of April 2019, there are 50 participants in the PESONet and 39 in the Instapay. We expect more over the near term.\\nOn financial education, the BSP is partnering with various institutions so that we are able to teach its concepts and principles to our target audience, which includes students, overseas Filipinos and their families, recipients of the government's conditional and unconditional cash transfers, uniformed personnel, MSMEs, and civil servants.\\nTogether with this is consumer empowerment initiatives. Work is now ongoing on the chatbot functionality, which will enable consumers to submit complaints via SMS, webchat, and messenger applications. At the same time, the BSP is pushing for the Financial Consumer Protection bill, which seeks to strengthen regulations that protect financial consumers.\\nOn capital market development, the BSP in collaboration with other financial regulators is pursuing policy reforms and initiatives that will promote a wider array of and accessibility to investment products-so that people from various income groups are able to engage in investment activities.\\nWith these initiatives and those of the government, we have a very solid basis to be optimistic about the future. \\nBased on latest government estimates, the country's macroeconomic fundamentals will continue to paint a positive narrative for the Philippine economy over the next three years. These are led by an even more robust economic growth, stable inflation, and healthy external payments position.\\nAmid this backdrop, we invite the private sector to actively partner with the government by investing more in the Philippines' future, so that you can ride along the economy's growth tide.\\nHaving said this, there will always be risks to the growth outlook. At the moment, some of the challenges ahead include global economic growth slowdown, the US-China trade war, geopolitical tensions, disruptive technologies, infrastructure gaps, and weather disturbances.\\nRest assured the BSP will keep a watchful eye on these domestic and external headwinds to help maintain economic stability for the Philippines.\\nWith a goal of becoming \"closer to the Filipino people,\" the BSP commits to proactively using monetary, financial, and payments and settlements channels so that Filipinos feel the benefits of a robustly growing economy.\\nIn closing, allow me to give you some key notes:\\nFirst, the Philippines is expected to remain among the fastest growing economies in the world.\\nSecond, the government is committed to its massive infrastructure agenda, which is helping fuel high, sustainable, and more inclusive economic growth.\\nThird, the Philippines is resilient to shocks, and the BSP is committed to continue effectively managing the country's external accounts to help ensure this resilience is maintained.\\nFourth, your BSP will continue to maintain a regulatory environment that allows the financial system to remain stable, to flourish, and to further support growth of the economy.\\nFifth, your BSP will continue to pursue initiatives toward an even more efficient, dynamic, and inclusive financial system.\\nSixth, your BSP, will remain committed to its core mandate of price stability, and stands ready to use any of its tools, if and when necessary, for effective inflation management.\\nIn brief, the BSP will continue to carry out its objectives and mandates for the ultimate benefit of the Filipino people. Thank you and good day."

        "content": "Honorable Mayor Reynaldo L. Catacutan, of the Municipality of Capas, dear Cabinet members, heads of agencies, and local officials, members of the Monetary Board and fellow workers in government, guests from the private sector, media, ladies and gentlemen-\\nMayap a abak kakayu ngan! (Good morning to you all!)\\nBefore anything else, I would like to thank Mayor Rey for his kind words and warm welcome. On behalf of the Monetary Board and the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, I would like to extend my gratitude to the officials and residents of the municipality of Capas, as well as to our friends from the provincial government of Tarlac, for your hospitality.\\nSecond, I would like to thank BCDA President and CEO, Mr. Vince Dizon, for graciously hosting today's event onsite at the New Clark City. I know this is a busy time for BCDA since preparations for the upcoming Southeast Asian Games are in full-swing.\\nBut knowing Vince and his brand of leadership, I am sure that his agile team is well-capable of juggling the many activities taking place in this true \"City of the Future.\"\\nDear friends, this ceremony today represents the first of many important milestones, as BSP aims to relocate its Security Plant Complex, or \"SPC\". As you well know, the existing SPC, which houses the Bank's currency production operations, is located on a seven-hectare plot of land along East Avenue in Quezon City.\\nInaugurated in 1978, the BSP SPC ushered in no less than four generations of banknotes and coins. The SPC is also where we print land titles for the Land Registration Authority, craft presidential medals and commemorative coins, and soon, it will also be where we will print the National ID cards for the Philippine Statistical Authority.\\nAfter forty years of service, it is now ripe for a major upgrade that will ensure that the Bangko Sentral remains at the cutting-edge of currency production and security printing technologies. It was because of this that led the BSP and the Monetary Board here to the New Clark City.\\nIt is worth noting that the BSP follows a very rigorous set of criteria in selecting sites for its facilities. These standards-which include everything from lot configuration, site conditions, to infrastructural support-are intended to ensure that the BSP's operations are suitably located. After an exhaustive canvass of sites north and south of Metro Manila, it is crystal clear that the New Clark City is the only one that met the requirements of the BSP-with flying colors, might I add.\\nIn my previous stint as Budget Secretary, I was fortunate to have a hand in crafting and implementing the \"Build, Build, Build\" Program of the Government, which is aimed to usher in a \"Golden Age of Infrastructure\" in the Philippines.\\nOne of the key elements of that program is the establishment of a new government center on this very location. Under the leadership of BCDA President and CEO Vince Dizon, the New Clark City is rapidly transforming itself to a resilient metropolis that will drive growth momentum in \"Paspas Capas\"1, Tarlac, as well as in other nearby provinces in central and northern Luzon.\\nWith the National Government Administrative Center situated just around the corner, as well as the continuing influx of government institutions setting up shop within the complex, the New Clark City is also clearly geared towards responsive governance and public service.\\nToday, as Governor of the Bangko Sentral, I'm gretly honored to lay the groundwork for bringing one of the country's most trusted government institutions to this most vibrant growth corridor.\\nIn the Memorandum of Understanding which we are signing today, the BSP and BCDA agree to work hand-in-hand to facilitate the relocation of the BSP Security Plant to the New Clark City, on the plot of land just outside of this tent. Once the details of relocation are threshed out, BSP and BCDA will formalize its respective commitments under a new Memorandum of Agreement, which will serve as the implementing document for this purpose.\\nFrom there, we will work unceasingly to complete the development within the shortest timeframe possible, at the highest level of quality and workmanship. We will explore the various modes of procurement available in order to leverage local and international expertise in the design and construction of the new SPC.\\nSpeaking of which, in a few moments from now, we will be showcasing the concept design crafted by our very own architects in the BSP Currency Management Sector, to give you a glimpse of the complex that we plan to establish just outside this venue. Consistent with the spirit of the New Clark City, the concept envisions a facility that will serve as a leading benchmark for a smart, green, modern complex, not just within the country, but on the global scale as well.\\nWe also envision an industrial facility that will employ state-of-the-art technologies that will foster high-yield production systems, efficient workflows, while maintaining a low energy footprint. Likewise, with the ample area being considered, the facility will feature expansive greenery and natural living spaces - which are short supply in Metro Manila - to exemplify the BSP's continuing commitment to health, well-being, and environmental preservation.\\nSo allow me to end my remarks by calling your attention to the screen in front as we proudly unveil the concept design of the new BSP Security Plant Complex which will rise in the New Clark City.\\nMabuhay po tayong lahat.\\nMabuhay ang Bansang Pilipinas.\\n1 \"Paspas Capas\" is the municipality's motto/slogan."

        "title": "Philip R Lane: Interview in Handelsblatt",
        "content": "Mr Lane, the ECB launched a big monetary policy package in September. Was that really necessary?\\nIn my view, it wasn't such a large package. We reduced the interest rate that banks are charged on their deposits at the ECB by 0.1 percentage points to -0.5%, and we adjusted our forward guidance on the outlook for interest rates. That's not dramatic. And we decided to conduct net asset purchases at a rate of \\u20ac20 billion per month, which is much less than the peak of \\u20ac80 billion a month that we had in the past.\\nWhat made an impression on many observers was the fact that these measures are not time-limited. Will we have to live with negative interest rates indefinitely?\\nOur measures will stay in place until the economy recovers and inflation robustly converges again towards our aim of below, but close to, 2%. This forward guidance dependent on the inflation outlook is the key element of our September decision. It is especially effective under conditions of elevated uncertainty as it facilitates a smooth and stabilising adjustment of expectations about the future policy path to the arrival of positive and negative news. It is only if you are very pessimistic that you take this to mean a very long time. But there are good reasons not to be so pessimistic, also because of our policy actions.\\nWhat economic developments do you expect to see?\\nOur expectation is that we are currently going through a patch of temporary weakness. Inflation is below our aim, but there is no danger of deflation, meaning a general fall in price levels.\\nSo why did you loosen monetary policy at all in September? Couldn't you just have waited for the soft patch to pass?\\nProjected inflation for 2021 stood at 1.8% in December 2018. But in March this year the ECB had to revise its outlook for growth and inflation significantly downwards, and in September projected inflation was revised down again to 1.5%. So we waited until September to provide a comprehensive response. When there was no improvement by that point, we took action. In the medium term we want to see a stronger economy, higher inflation and definitely also positive interest rates again. In September we judged that in order to get to that point, interest rates had to be lowered.\\nWhat are the assumptions on which the ECB bases its projections?\\nOur baseline assumption is that there will be an orderly Brexit and the trade conflicts will be resolved. But there are still prominent downside risks.\\nLet's talk about the individual measures. Economists on the outside as well as members of the ECB's Governing Council have been critical of the asset purchases in particular. The Governing Council seems to be divided.\\nThe difference of opinion stems from the fact that the economic situation is not very clear. In the past, it was usually fairly obvious what measures needed to be taken.\\nAnd that's not the case right now?\\nWe're looking at a temporary economic slowdown, but there is no recession and the risk of deflation is low at present. There is broad agreement that the situation warrants action, and that's what's important. Opinions diverged only on the size and type of measures to be taken.\\nSome central bank chiefs, including Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann, publicly criticised the decision immediately after it had been taken. Does that damage the ECB's credibility?\\nI don't think it's a problem for the outside world to know that there are a number of different viewpoints, because that shows that we strive, collectively and collegially, to reach the right decision. Incidentally, it's quite normal for there to be differences of opinion at other central banks such as the Bank of England or the Federal Reserve. The important thing is that we make the decision collectively and implement it collectively.\\nBut how do you explain the fact that the ECB is planning to buy additional government bonds even though their yield is already below zero?\\nThe reason yields are so low is that the economic outlook has deteriorated and the market was already expecting us to loosen monetary policy in response to that deterioration. If we had not done so, rates would have risen, and that would have exacerbated the weakness in the economy.\\nMany economists are arguing that the German government in particular should be doing more in terms of fiscal policy to support the economy. What is your view?\\nCountries with high levels of government debt should concentrate on structural reforms. But large countries with sound finances can stimulate demand during a period of economic weakness through public spending or tax breaks. So when they're planning their budgets, governments should think about what developments they expect to see in the year ahead. Private consumption and private investment have both fallen recently.\\nIf fiscal policy doesn't do its bit, does that weaken the effectiveness of monetary policy?\\nMonetary policy can change aggregate demand. At the same time, its effectiveness is dependent on how overall demand is expected to develop in the future: the better the prospects, the stronger is the monetary stimulus on the economy. The government can influence the expected evolution of aggregate demand through fiscal policy. The weaker this evolution is expected to be, the more monetary policy has to do.\\nHow big is the potential impact of fiscal policy, in your view?\\nTwo conditions need to be met for government spending to be effective. First, it works particularly well when the economy is not running at full capacity. Second, it's important that, if the government increases spending and stimulates the economy, it doesn't cause inflation to rise too far. If that were to happen, monetary policy would need to take counteracting measures, thereby reducing the impact. And there is no risk of inflation being too high at the moment. In addition, the positive impact of government spending is particularly strong in an environment of low interest rates. Additional spending gives firms additional reassurance that their investment will be met with demand.\\nWould closer cooperation between monetary and fiscal policy be warranted at such times?\\nThere's a good reason why central banks are independent. So I wouldn't talk about cooperation. But it can only help for governments to have a good understanding of how our monetary policy works. That's why we're very transparent on this.\\nWhat do you mean by that?\\nAnyone in the finance ministry can see that euro area inflation is well below our objective. And that means that higher public spending will not dramatically affect financing conditions.\\nLet's go back to monetary policy. Which measure do you think is more significant, the interest rate cut or asset purchases?\\nThe important thing is that they work together. The rate cut allows us to steer interest rates of short and intermediate maturities, in particular, through the expectations component of these rates. Asset purchases can complement this effect by containing the so-called term premium of longer-term interest rates.\\nHow much room for manoeuvre do you have left when it comes to cutting interest rates?\\nThe effect of a rate cut is stimulative because it fosters more favourable financing conditions. We need to see whether, at some point, there might be side effects that work in the opposite direction. We have to look at this again every time. Our monetary policy has so far had a clearly positive impact on financing conditions for firms and households, and is thus supporting growth and inflation.\\nHow low can interest rates go before they start to have a constraining rather than a stimulative impact?\\nThe traditional view is that interest rates can continue to fall up to the point at which people withdraw their money and put their cash in a safe. For some time now, other economic effects have also been taken into account, with the question being whether, as a whole, further interest rate cuts have the desired monetary policy effect.\\nIf people don't earn any interest these days, they need to save even more for their old age and can consume less as a result.\\nYes, but you do need to see the overall picture. The size of incomes is the key factor when it comes to economic development and, in the final analysis, also savings: the higher are incomes, the more can be saved. And expansionary monetary policy boosts incomes, partly through employment and wage growth. Furthermore, there are not just savers; there are also borrowers who benefit from low interest rates.\\nSo you could lower interest rates even further?\\nYes, we see enough leeway for further interest rate cuts, should they be necessary. There are some countries, like Denmark and Switzerland, that have lowered interest rates even further.\\nCould the ECB cut interest rates as far as those countries have?\\nWe do of course look at the examples in other countries. That said, the euro area is a much larger economy than Denmark or Switzerland, so the situations there are only comparable to a limited extent.\\nYour monetary policy works through the entire financial system. How important is it in this context for the banks to make decent profits?\\nIt can be important at least. This is why we adopted \"tiering\", or allowances up to which banks can deposit excess liquidity with the ECB at 0% interest. A monetary policy problem would arise if the banks became reluctant to grant loans due to excessively weak earnings. But we haven't observed that yet.\\nNevertheless, people are asking whether, with such low interest rates, we are approaching the point where monetary policy is no longer effective.\\nMonetary policy is still effective, as we've seen over recent years. The fundamental mechanisms have not changed. At the same time, it is clear that we need to act with great care as our interest rates are already negative and we've already built up a large portfolio of bonds.\\nSo why is inflation reacting so little to your monetary policy?\\nWe see that wages are rising, particularly in Germany. For some time, prices followed suit. But companies are now facing huge uncertainty, due mainly to Brexit and the trade conflicts. This is why they are reluctant to pass on the increase in labour costs to their customers.\\nI have a technical question in this context. The ECB is only permitted to buy around one-third of the government bonds issued by each country. Some economists have calculated that, with new purchases of \\u20ac20 billion each month, you will already reach a limit, primarily in Germany, after less than a year.\\nAccording to our calculations, this may not become a problem for an extended period of time, and in any case not for at least as long as we can project bond availability conditions with some confidence. It is important to keep in mind that the forecasts depend on many parameters you assume.\\nOne of these is the price elasticity of those investors who hold the bonds in the private sector. Building on past experience, these investors have proven more willing to sell, even in response to relatively small price adjustments, than we had anticipated. This makes our life easier as it eases constraints.\\nFor some time to come means that you believe the limits for Germany will not be reached in the next one to two years?\\nIf we had seen any potential constraints in this regard in the near future, we would have included this in the calibration of the additional purchases.\\nDo you assume that some countries will increase their debt?\\nNo, such considerations do not play a role in our calculations. We work on the basis of whatever the governments have already agreed.\\nIf the limit is reached, the ECB could of course also deviate from the key according to which purchases are weighted by the size of the respective euro area countries.\\nWe will continue to purchase with a view to bringing the share of the PSPP portfolio into close alignment with the respective national central banks' subscription to the ECB capital key.\\nSome critics also accuse the ECB of effecting its monetary policy primarily via the exchange rate.\\nThe sole objective of our monetary policy is to fulfil our mandate of maintaining price stability. The exchange rate is of course one factor for the economy, and hence also for inflation; in this context, the exchange rate is an important element but not the objective of our monetary policy. What's more, we haven't seen any major change in the euro exchange rate for some time now.\\nBut the announcement of asset purchases put the euro under massive pressure in 2014-.\\n- after it had risen sharply prior to that. This was a correction of a previous overvaluation.\\nSeen overall, the euro area has generated a trade surplus over recent years. That would normally strengthen the euro in the long run.\\nExperience suggests that such an impact does exist, but it is very, very long term. It develops over decades rather than years.\\nLet's turn again to the core of monetary policy - the inflation aim. For a number of months now, the ECB has been speaking of symmetry in its aim. At the same time, though, it is maintaining that inflation should remain below, but close to, 2%. How does that fit together?\\nFirst and foremost, it means that we combat deviations above that aim and below that aim with the same determination. If inflation is above our aim of inflation at levels that are below, but close to, 2%, we try just as hard to get it there as when inflation is below the aim.\\nBut isn't it foolish to set such precise targets? Surely the ECB is not able to steer inflation that accurately.\\nWe're aiming for this in the medium term, not for a specific year. Which gives us some room for manoeuvre.\\nHow long exactly is the medium term?\\nThat depends especially on the source of the shock. A demand shock requires a shorter horizon for the policy response, that is policy should be less patient, whereas a supply shock may call for a longer horizon, and hence more patience.\\nWouldn't it make sense to allow more downward scope in the inflation aim?\\nThe aim must be crystal clear, especially when inflation is low. The closer it is to zero, the more pressure we find ourselves under to act.\\nSome critics think that a temporary bout of deflation would not be a disaster.\\nIf it comes from a boom in productivity and higher real incomes, and ends foreseeably quickly, then no, it's not. But it must be certain that inflation can be anchored above zero again. Close to 2%, to be precise, otherwise the room for manoeuvre in our future monetary policy would be permanently limited.\\nThe Federal Reserve is currently reviewing its monetary policy strategy. Should the ECB follow this example?\\nI believe that it is time for a review. The world is changing. For instance, we should analyse how other central banks behave when it comes to inflation targets. The importance of monetary policy instruments should also play a role. The best way might be to carry out a review at regular intervals.\\nIf it comes to a fundamental discussion of the new strategy under new ECB President Christine Lagarde in future, would a change in the inflation aim also be conceivable? Maybe also a higher objective?\\nAn objective of around 2% has established itself as the international norm. Deviating greatly from this could create uncertainty and pose risks, as it could, for example, generate undesirable capital flows, for instance."

        "title": "Philip Lowe: Remarks at Reserve Bank Board Dinner",
        "content": "Good evening. On behalf of the Reserve Bank Board I would like to thank you for joining us at this community dinner. The Board held its monthly meeting here in Melbourne today. This was the first meeting that we have held in our new offices on Collins Street after last year selling our building on the corner of Collins and Exhibition Streets. So even if we are in a different location, it is really good to be back in Melbourne.\\nAs you are probably aware, at our meeting today, the Board decided to cut the cash rate by a quarter of one per cent to 0.75 per cent.\\nThis decision followed a detailed assessment of both global and domestic developments.\\nGlobally, the main issue at the moment is the uncertainty generated by a series of geopolitical events, particularly the US-China disputes over trade and technology. Understandably, this uncertainty is causing many firms around the world to sit and wait before proceeding with costly investment decisions. At the same time, many businesses are having to deal with disruptions to their supply chains. The result of all this is that after a period of reasonable growth in the global economy, the risks are clearly to the downside.\\nCentral banks are responding to these downside risks by lowering interest rates. With inflation low - and expected to remain low - they are seeking to take out some insurance against the possibility of a noticeable slowdown in economic growth.\\nFrom a longer-term perspective though, central banks have for some time been responding to fundamental shifts in the global appetite to save and invest. The underlying explanation for low interest rates globally is that the global appetite to save is high relative to the global appetite to invest.\\nLike many things in economics it comes down to supply and demand. When the global supply of savings is high relative to the global demand for funding to invest in new capital, the price of savings - or the global interest rate - is going to be low. There are certainly other factors at play as well, but savings and investment decisions are at the heart of the issue.\\nThis means that the key to a return to more normal interest rates globally is addressing the factors that are leading to the low appetite to invest, relative to the appetite to save. This is mainly a task for governments and businesses, not for central banks. Whether or not this will happen, only time will tell. But as a central bank in a small open economy we have to take the world as we find it. While we might wish it were otherwise, we can't ignore these global trends and their impact on our economy. So, the Board is watching these global developments.\\nDomestically, the Board today discussed how the Australian economy appears to have reached a gentle turning point. The economy has been through a soft patch recently, but we are expecting a return to around trend growth over the next year. There are a number of factors that are supporting this outlook. These include the low level of interest rates, the recent tax cuts, ongoing spending on infrastructure, signs of stabilisation in some established housing markets, and a brighter outlook for the resources sector. Together, these factors provide a reasonable basis for expecting that the economy will remain on an improving trend from here.\\nThe Board has also been paying close attention to the labour market. Over recent years, employment growth has consistently surprised on the upside, which is good news. At the same time, the strong demand for workers has been met with strong growth in the supply of available workers, with the participation rate now at a record high. Partly as a result of this flexibility on the supply side, unemployment is a little higher than it was at the beginning of the year, and there has not been much upward pressure on wages. In turn, this has contributed to the extended run of inflation outcomes below the medium-term target range.\\nIn considering these developments today, the Board decided that it was appropriate to ease monetary policy further. We are seeking to make more assured progress towards both full employment and the inflation target. We still expect to make progress on both fronts, but that progress is slower than we would like. Today's decision will help.\\nIn reaching that decision, the Board recognises that the impact of monetary policy on the economy has changed over time, and that there can be some undesirable side effects from low interest rates. The many people who write to me saying how low interest rates are hurting their finances serve as a constant reminder of this.\\nBut, importantly, the Board also recognises that monetary policy still works. It works to support employment, jobs and income growth across the economy. Today's decision, together with our decisions in June and July, will assist on each of these fronts. In doing so, these decisions will promote the collective economic welfare of the Australian people, which we need to remember is the ultimate goal of monetary policy.\\nEven so, my earlier point about the solution to low interest rates globally is relevant here in Australia too. We will all be better off if businesses have the confidence to expand, invest, innovate and hire people. Given Australia's strong longer-term fundamentals this should not be out of our reach, but it does require constant effort. One part of this effort could be a renewed focus on structural measures to lift the nation's productivity performance.\\nAt our meeting today, as well as considering monetary policy, the Board had its six-monthly deep dive into financial stability issues. On Friday, the Bank will be releasing the results of this in our Financial Stability Review. Ahead of that, I would highlight three issues we discussed.\\nThe first is that internationally, there seems to be a disconnect between the uncertainty that investors feel about the economic situation and the compensation that they require for holding risk. Normally when people feel uncertain about the future, they want to be compensated for taking on risk. At the moment though, despite the uncertainty, credit spreads are low and asset prices are generally high. At our meeting today we talked about the possibility that a shock somewhere in the global system could cause a recalibration, leading to a disruptive repricing of risk.\\nThe second issue is that the resilience of Australia's financial system has steadily improved over recent times. The core capital ratios of our banks are now well within the top quartile of banks around the world. Our banks are well placed to withstand a wide range of shocks and their position will be further strengthened as they meet requirements to increase their loss absorbing capacity further over the next few years.\\nLending standards have also been strengthened, although in some areas the pendulum may have swung a bit too far. It is important that our financial institutions support small businesses in particular. Lenders should not be so scared of making a loan that goes bad that they don't provide the credit that the economy needs.\\nOne other risk area that we are paying close attention to is cyber and technology risks. Banks' systems have become more complex and digital platforms are now key to banking. We need to make sure that these systems are safe and resilient.\\nThe third issue is that while the Australian household sector has a high level of debt, it has also built up substantial buffers. All up, the balances in mortgage offset accounts and redraw facilities amount to 16 per cent of outstanding housing debt. This is equivalent to around 2\\xbd years of required mortgage payments at current interest rates. It is important to recognise though that this figure masks a lot of variation across households. We estimate that around a quarter of households with a mortgage have either no buffer or a very small one.\\nLoan arrears remain low, although they have risen over recent years. Also, we estimate that for almost 4 per cent of borrowers their current loan balance exceeds the value of their property. Over half of these borrowers are in Western Australia where there has been a large and persistent decline in housing prices. So this is an area that bears watching.\\nOn a completely different matter, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that we will be releasing the new $20 note next week, on 9 October. This note is printed here in Melbourne, at our printing works in Craigieburn. I have brought along a few notes tonight hot off the presses for you to have a look at.\\nI sometimes get asked why the Reserve Bank is replacing the existing series of banknotes, especially when more of us are moving to electronic payments. People also wonder with contactless payments now so ubiquitous, do we still need banknotes?\\nGiven these questions, it might surprise you then to know that the demand for banknotes in Australia is still strong. The stock of banknotes on issue, relative to the size of the economy, is close to the highest it has been in 50 years. It is possible that low interest rates are part of the story here. All up, there are 14 $100 notes on issue for every Australian, 30 $50s, and 7 $20s. That makes for around $3000 worth of banknotes on issue for every Australian. I, for one, don't have anywhere near that amount.\\nAt the RBA, we have recently undertaken some work to understand the whereabouts of all these banknotes. It is hard to know exactly, but we estimate that around a quarter are used to make legitimate day-to-day transactions within Australia.1 It also appears that between half and three-quarters are held as a store of value in safes, under beds and at the back of cupboards, both here in Australia and elsewhere around the world. We estimate that a further 4 to 8 per cent are used in the shadow economy, either to hide transactions from the tax office or to undertake illegal transactions. Finally, it appears that between 5 and 10 per cent of banknotes are either simply lost, maybe at the beach, or destroyed, perhaps in a natural disaster. So, as best we can tell, that is where all the banknotes are.\\nOne indicator of the decline in the use of banknotes for day-to-day transactions is the fact that the value of cash withdrawals through ATMs has fallen by a quarter over the past decade. Australians have clearly embraced the convenience of contactless payments. We are also increasingly embracing payments through Australia's fast 24/7 payment system, the New Payments Platform. If you have not already got your PayID to use the simple addressing feature of this new system, I encourage you to get one. If your bank is not offering this new fast payment service to you, I encourage you to ask them why. And if you are not happy with the answer, give some thought to switching banks.\\nBefore finishing I would like to return to the question of why we have been issuing a new series of banknotes. The main answer is to keep ahead of the counterfeiters. We have long had one of the safest and most secure currencies in the world. The level of counterfeiting in Australia is low and declining, with around 15 counterfeits detected per million banknotes in circulation in recent times. This compares with rates above 50 for some other major currencies. But the counterfeiters don't stand still and we need to stay ahead. So we have added new high-tech security features to the new banknotes so that they remain safe, secure and reliable. For those of you who still use banknotes for your spending, it would be good to see a bit more use and spending out there.\\nFinally, I would like to thank you again for joining us this evening. We are looking forward to hearing directly from you about how things are going here in Victoria. \\n1 For more information, see Finlay R, A Staib and M Wakefield (2018), 'Where's the Money\\u203d An Investigation into the Whereabouts and Uses of Australian Banknotes', RBA Research Discussion Paper No 2018-12."

        "content": "It is a pleasure to contribute to UCLA's Master of Applied Economics Distinguished Speaker Series. Los Angeles is a good setting for me to reflect upon the importance of globalisation: around USD 300 billion of US imports and exports pass through the port here every year - around half of which are to or from China - while Californian firms are at the forefront of many global industries. Globalisation has fundamentally reshaped how the major advanced economies operate (including both the euro area and the United States). The rest of the world is a major destination for the goods and services these design and produce, while providing a broad choice of imports for domestic producers and consumers. Alongside this, the financial systems of the advanced economies have been transformed through global financial flows, while the technological frontier is driven by the global pace of innovation.\\nIt directly follows that central banks must take into account the impact of globalisation on both macro-financial dynamics and the transmission mechanisms through which monetary policy operates. Accordingly, my aim in this lecture is to analyse some dimensions of how globalisation affects the monetary policy of the ECB."

        "content": "Good afternoon, everyone. It is with great pleasure that I welcome all of you to the 2019 Awards Ceremony and Appreciation Dinner for BSP Stakeholders in Region III.\\nI am pleased that the BSP has been recognizing the invaluable contributions of its partners in central banking for the past 16 years now. The growth in the number and scope of awards given reflects the dynamic support and cooperation you have extended to the BSP's various initiatives and advocacies, which are all geared toward improving the life of every Filipino.\\nI cannot overemphasize the value of your support as the BSP continues to navigate the country's economic landscape.   By working as one team, we have entered this year from a position of strength and with renewed optimism. Based on the country's economic performance, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 6.2 percent year-on-year in 2018 and remained firm at 5.5 percent in the first semester of 2019. On the production side, economic growth was propelled mainly by the robust performance of the services sectors. Broad-based expansion in household consumption and government spending reinforced growth on the demand side.\\nMeanwhile, January to August 2019 inflation readings have averaged  3.0 percent, well within the announced target range of 2 to 4 percent of the National Government. Last August, inflation slowed down to 1.7 percent.\\nThe external position of the Philippines is reflective of an economy driven by solid macroeconomic fundamentals and firm growth prospects.\\nThe country's balance of payments (BOP) position for the first seven months of the year posted a surplus of US$5 billion, a turnaround from the US$3.7 billion BOP deficit recorded in the same period last year.\\nThe surplus may be attributed partly to remittance inflows from overseas Filipinos during the first six months of the year, and net inflows of foreign direct investments during the first five months of the year.\\nSustained inflows of foreign exchange are expected to continue to support the peso.\\nIn the first six months of the year, net inflows of foreign direct investments (FDI) reached US$3.6 billion. Meanwhile, foreign portfolio investments (FPI) reversed to net inflows of US$5.3 billion in the first semester of 2019, from US$708 million net outflows in the same period last year.\\nPersonal remittances for January to June 2019 totaled US$16.3 billion, higher by 2.9 percent than the US$15.8 billion level recorded in the same period last year. This was achieved despite increasing global efforts to de-risk banks and tighten regulations of money transfer operations.\\nThe country's gross international reserves (GIR) continue to serve as an ample external liquidity buffer. Preliminary data shows that the country's gross international reserves (GIR) rose to US$85.6 billion as of end-August 2019. At this level, the GIR can cover up to 7.5 months' worth of imports of goods and payments of services and primary income.\\nThe country's external debt remained manageable.\\nExternal debt as a proportion to the country's GDP increased to 24 percent in the first semester of 2019. Despite this moderate uptick, external debt-to-GDP has remained below 25 percent since 2016.\\nOur financial system remains sound and continues to effectively intermediate funds to productive sectors, thus promoting economic growth.\\nIn the first semester of 2019, banks' balance sheets exhibited steady growth in both assets and deposits.\\nAsset quality also remained stable while capital adequacy ratios stayed well-above international standards. Banks maintained dominance in the financial sector, with universal and commercial banks (U/KBs) accounting for about 91 percent of banks' total resources. In terms of the number of head offices and branches/agencies, non-bank financial intermediaries have the widest physical network, consisting mainly of pawnshops.\\nFrom this position of strength, the BSP remains committed to continually uphold the highest standard of excellence in crafting policies to maintain price stability, promote a strong financial system, and foster a safe and efficient payments and settlement system.\\nThe ability of the BSP to deliver on its mandates depends significantly not only on its commitment, but also on its credibility, supported by its dynamic engagement with its stakeholders.\\nIndeed, we can rightfully say that credibility is a major part of the institutional capital of the BSP as the country's central bank. Thus, by establishing and maintaining consistent engagement with our partners, the BSP is able to capture the sentiment of its stakeholders, which helps us formulate and calibrate effective monetary policies.\\nThrough the years, your support has become increasingly more important in our various initiatives and advocacies directed toward the fulfillment of our mandates.\\nFor instance, in July 2017, the BSP launched the BSP E-Survey Portal that features an online questionnaire, database, and an application for data maintenance and consolidation system. In 2018, the portal's registered users increased to 1,706 from the 860 registered users in 2017. And, as of end-June of this year, the number of registered users rose to 2019.\\nThis is one of the many endeavors of the BSP that highlight the importance of the information support you provide us to aid in our policy formulation.\\nThe BSP has, likewise, responded to the call of digitization by pioneering the National Retail Payment System (NRPS). The NRPS is a policy and regulatory framework to establish a safe, efficient and reliable retail payment system in the Philippines.\\nWith this initiative, digital payments have become more accessible to every Filipino. We, at the BSP, cannot stress enough how you have taken a pivotal role in helping the financial sector develop in this age of fast-paced technological advancement and integration.\\nToday, as we celebrate our rewarding partnership, we must also reflect on the motivations behind it. This year's theme, \"One Team One Goal: Resilient Partnership Towards Inclusive Economic Growth,\" highlights the fact that the BSP cannot do it alone. With your support, the BSP is able to continuously craft policies that are appropriate for the nation.\\nLadies and gentlemen, by working as a team, we will be more than ready to face the challenges head on and deliver on our common goal of achieving sustainable and inclusive economic growth and development in the Philippines.\\nThank you and congratulations to all our outstanding partners!"

        "title": "Abdul Rasheed Ghaffour: Islamic finance and halal industry - opportunity, impact, synergy",
        "content": "\"Opportunity...Impact...Synergy...\"\\n...Introduction in Malaysian...\\nMalaysia is well-positioned to capitalise on huge opportunities in the global halal industry\\nThe global halal business is thriving. This creates abundance of opportunity. In its report on \"The State of the Islamic Economy 2018 - 2019\", Thomson Reuters projected the size of global halal industry to grow from USD2.1 trillion in 2017 to USD3.1 trillion by 2023. Growing global population of young and affluent Muslims1, is among the main drivers supporting such demand. Domestically, this is further supported by the Malaysian demography of Muslim-majority. As a nation, Malaysia has the necessary ingredients to seize the opportunity. Infrastructure for halal business is comprehensive. The halal certification programme by JAKIM is internationally-recognised and well-sought after. Malaysia also has a mature domestic Islamic financial system that stands ready to respond to the evolving and growing needs of businesses. This is evidenced by Malaysia reigning the Thomson Reuters Global Islamic Economy Indicator Index (GIEI) for five consecutive years.\\nThe global numbers are exciting. The prospects are great. But, Malaysia remains a small player in the halal trade internationally. As at Q4 2018, halal exports amounted to RM40.0 billion or only 4 percent of total Malaysian exports, of which halal exports by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) account for a mere 8.4 percent2. To capture the market, businesses in the halal industry need to be agile and be quick to respond to changing consumer preferences and behaviours. This means business practices and processes need to be re-calibrated to be more aligned with sustainable expectations. Similarly, quality enhancements are given expectations in terms of product offerings, using a more current and efficient distribution channels and payments methods. In conjunction with Japan Olympic 2020, for example, there is a strong demand for halal products with high traffic of tourists, supporters and spectators. Companies which are able to satisfy the high bar placed by Japan on production, quality, safety and health aspects, will be able to open up a series of medium to longer term opportunities to export to other countries. As such, securing a suitable financial solution to upgrade and upscale production to meet the demand and requirements, would be an important prerequisite for businesses.\\nRecognising these key success factors, recent announcement by Government to introduce The Halal Industry Strategic Development Programme, or 'be-Halal' - under the National Halal Council Secretariat to drive the growth of the halal industry is timely. Under \"be-Halal\", participants will be developed further through programmes run by experts in various fields to enable them to be more innovative and progressive as they face various global challenges and ultimately contribute to the nation's halal industry. \\nIslamic finance has become part of the mainstream with offerings of competitive financial solutions\\nMalaysia has an Islamic financial system that operates alongside the conventional system. Our unique experience with a dual financial system has been effective on many fronts - effective in bringing segments of the society to access the services of the formal financial system; effective in enabling and facilitating businesses, especially the small and medium-sized entrepreneurs, to expand their businesses; and effective in steering development of the country. We have a comprehensive Islamic financial system comprising the core components of banking, takaful and capital markets. The Islamic finance system have matured and are as competitive with the conventional system, thus providing better choices and options. A robust financial infrastructure is also in place to support development of this system, alongside a responsive regulatory and supervisory framework whilst achieving the high standards of best practice in corporate governance and in financial transparency and disclosure. The Islamic financial system consistently reinforces its position as a viable and effective means of intermediation that contributes to the overall economic development.\\nToday, Islamic banking accounts for 33 percent of Malaysia's total banking assets while takaful market share stands at 11 percent for family takaful and 10.1 percent for general takaful. The Islamic financial system continues to grow - at a pace faster than the conventional system. As at end-June 2019, financing outstanding of Islamic banks expanded at 8.6 percent compared to 2.1 percent for the conventional. Meanwhile, new general takaful contributions grew at 16.4 percent compared to 6.2 percent for the insurance premium. However, new family takaful contributions grew at 10 percent, slightly lower to life insurance premium of 15.4 percent. \\nThis brings me to the point on impact. Financial institutions, through its intermediary actions, can be an effective agent of change for businesses and economy. In 2018, a number of Islamic financial institutions began adopting a change in their business philosophy. By embracing value-based intermediation or VBI, more comprehensive financial solutions, beyond just financing, are provided. These may include assistance and advisory as well as capacity building opportunities to businesses in their journey to transition to a more efficient, environmentally friendly and sustainable business as part of financing. To illustrate, Islamic financial institutions will play greater nurturing role in advocating sustainable practices among their client. They will drive programme with other strategic partners who share similar aspirations to provide services beyond financing. Clients will be advised to adopt sustainable practices for example Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil Certification and necessary funding and technical advises will be provided to the clients accordingly. Traditional credit standards are also being reformed - taking into consideration prospects of a proposed project to create positive impact on wider stakeholders and community. \\nIn adapting to changing economic environment, businesses must have in place adequate risk management and protection. This is key to ensure business sustainability. Takaful operators offer a wide range of commercial protection schemes to help businesses build its risk management. These include protection against risks associated with natural disaster, weather-related events, payment default, professional indemnity and damage in crops, among others. For example, trade credit takaful solution to be launched in 2020 complements the wide range of trade finance solutions for importers and exporters that transact on an open account basis.\\nIslamic finance is a natural fit for halalan-toyyiban\\nLet me now move on to the final component - the underlying strength which ties the halal opportunity with Islamic finance - synergy. At the national level, the government supports and recognises the role of Islamic finance as an important tool to develop and grow businesses and SMEs. In the 2019 Budget, the SME Shariah-Compliant Financing Scheme was established to strengthen the development of SMEs. Under the Scheme, the government has committed to subsidise 2 percent of profit rate or borrowing cost for total financing worth RM1.0 billion.\\nA number of other strategies are also being pursued to better position Islamic finance solutions to meet the needs of halal businesses. The industry players have participated in mega events such as Halal Expo 2019, Halfest 2019, and Festival Islam dan Halal Antarabangsa Johor Darul Ta'zim 2019 to create awareness on its offerings. The industry has also come together in demonstrating their commitment to businesses, in particular halal businesses and enhancing protection for halal businesses to venture into emerging markets. A dedicated RM20.0 billion yearly fund has been allocated by Islamic banks under AIBIM for SMEs including halal businesses. I urge eligible entrepreneurs to take this opportunity to empower their businesses and leverage on this platform in maximising business' potentials.\\nThere is now growing awareness of the concept of halalan-toyyiban - which calls for Shariah compliance to be assessed throughout the entire supply chain of the products including distribution, marketing, and financing. Currently, only 54.1 percent of halal businesses are bank-financed, and less than a quarter of the financing (21.9 percent) is in the form of Islamic solutions3. Islamic finance offers a variety of solutions through use of wide-range Islamic finance concepts such as sales based, leasing, profit sharing or partnership and many more that enables better fit for businesses' need. For example, businesses who wish to acquire equipment or commercial vehicles can explore Ijarah contract, which allows businesses to lease equipment or commercial vehicles from an Islamic bank on rental for the usage of equipment during the lease period. The total leased rental, which is fixed throughout the tenure provides businesses with a hedge against future rates movement and provides businesses with an avenue to improve and better manage cash flow. Currently, Islamic finance institutions are rigorously exploring more customised solutions and improving customer experience and journey. This is facilitated partly by a more adaptive and proportionate regulatory response.\\n...

        "title": "Philip R Lane: Q&A with Reuters",
        "content": "The following is a transcript of an on stage question and answer.\\nLet me welcome Philip Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB. That's a role he went to earlier this year having served as the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland since 2015. He has been an adviser to other international economic organisations, such as the IMF, OECD, World Bank and Asian Development Bank. He has a PhD in Economics from Harvard and earned his BA from Trinity College Dublin where, until recently, he was the Whately Professor of Political Economy. I'm also told he is a Liverpool fan, so he is riding high early in this Premier League season and we'll see if that confidence extends to team ECB. Mr Lane if you'd like to start.\\nOne reason I suppose that I wanted to talk here this morning was to further explain the context for our recent monetary policy decision. So if you look back over the last few years, if you look at the period from 2014 to 2018, essentially, the decision in 2014 by the ECB to tackle the risks of a slow-growing economy and the deflation risk in the euro area meant that during those years, from 2014 to 2018, what we saw was a fairly significant recovery. We had a big decline in unemployment in Europe, a very strong record of job creation and a significant stabilisation of inflation. So compared with the period in 2014, when deflation risk was on the horizon, there was a significant recovery in the inflation process through that period. And so to more recent monetary policy history, at the end of 2018 the decision was made that enough progress had been made in bringing inflation back towards the target that we would end the net asset purchases. Now in September 2019, part of the package that we announced a couple of weeks ago was: we did a small policy rate cut - the deposit facility rate went from -40 basis points to -50 basis points, we provided reinforced forward guidance and we restarted the net asset purchase programme (APP), running at \\u20ac20 billion a month. So you may ask: why was that necessary? Well, when we made the decision last December to end net purchases under our APP, the 2021 inflation forecast from the perspective of December 2018 was at 1.8%, so close to 2%. But what's happened this year? In March there was a significant downgrade in our outlook and that's essentially been confirmed in June and now in the September forecast. So now, as of September 2019 before we made this policy decision, the 2021 inflation forecast was 1.5%. So compared with 1.8% that's a big movement, from 1.8% to 1.5%. In that context, the decision was that we needed to revise our policy stance, which as I say is a rate cut, reinforced forward guidance, reopening of the APP and then there's the redesign of our targeted lending facility and the introduction of this new tiering system for how banks will be exempted, to some extent, from the implications of negative interest rates on their excess liquidity.\\nSo what we have is a very unusual situation, which is that many of the reasons why we were optimistic in 2018 remain. The labour market remains strong, services remain strong, consumption remains strong, household investment remains strong. So where's the decline? Essentially, manufacturing. So it's a very unusual, sector-specific asymmetric slowdown at the moment, which is not general across the economy but very, very visible in manufacturing. Of course, when you start to look at that - yes there are Europe-specific issues - but a lot has to do with the slowdown in global trade, which is some mix of trade policy, a kind of revision of the speed of growth in Asia, in particular, and related issues. So it's a very unusual situation. It's very important to say this is really not a dramatic policy move, it's a recalibration. We're not saying that there's a serious recession risk, we're not saying that there's a serious derailment of inflation, but there was a need to make a correction. And the last point I'll make in this opening is that it's very important in these circumstances that you do respond. When you do have inflation below the target, when you already have done a lot of accommodation, it is important, not to react to every little blip in the data. But when you see a significant deviation from the target it's important to respond, and that's what we've done.\\nThank you for laying out the context. So eurozone data continue to be skewed to the downside, particularly in Germany, where there seems to be a risk that this broad industrial weakness could be slipping into services. How significant is that? Is there a case to be made that Germany is already in recession?\\nSo let me make two points about that. One, Germany of course is very much an anchor country for the euro area, but Germany has a really unusual economic structure. It is not representative of the wider euro area because it's such a manufacturing powerhouse. So the manufacturing slowdown is disproportionately affecting Germany. At the ECB we look at aggregate euro area data, we don't go country by country, it's the aggregate that matters. So of course Germany is a significant factor but it's not the case that- so I think it would be a mistake, in fact I see it every day, it's tempting to read the German headlines and say this is a proxy for the euro area. But when you have a shock that is specific to manufacturing and when Germany has a much bigger manufacturing sector than, say, France or Spain in proportion, it would not be a good idea to extrapolate. When we say services are resilient, of course those service sectors which are selling to manufacturing are affected, there's no doubt about that, and then of course the spillover to the wider economy will be stronger in Germany than elsewhere. Let me also emphasise, though, that it remains the case that Germany, even with the slowdown (because remember they had such a spectacular performance in terms of the export dynamo for so many years)- So going back to 2018, 2017 was just an exceptional year, there was a slowdown in 2018 but by and large 2018 was just a little bit of a correction, returning to a more typical performance. What's interesting going from 2018 to 2019 is it's more than that, it's more than just slowing down from a kind of exceptional performance in 2017, but it's still the case that it's important to view this as an intermediate situation. There are definitely danger signals, I agree with you, there's a downward, we say it as well, there's downside risk, there's more downside risk than upside risk for obvious reasons, but the central forecast remains intermediate. The European economy will grow, we are projecting inflation to continue to increase, the labour market is very strong, wages are growing at quite a clip now. So it's a case where we just need to reinforce that by this extra policy move rather than some diagnosis or some major serious movement towards overall recession. Individual countries may tip for a while, but not the overall euro area, we don't see it.\\nSo I believe the staff forecasts for the near term have the aggregate growth rate balancing around 1%, a little bit above, for the near term. Is that too optimistic?\\nSo as a central forecast, I think the staff work hard to make sure that they strike a balance between optimism and pessimism. I think it's a reasonable central scenario. But a lot of risk in the world is a little bit bimodal. One of the issues we look at, of course, is trade policy. So the question is will these global trade disputes- Are they going to stagnate? Are they going to escalate and widen to a bigger trade war issue? Or will there be deals? If there are deals, that's upside risk. If it's basically stagnating, stalemating, that's kind of behind the central forecast. If it accelerates, then that's a downside risk. A local issue in Europe, of course, is Brexit, where there remains a lot of uncertainty and, clearly, if there's a no-deal Brexit that's going to be a downside risk. So there are obvious clear events, but these events will be realised one way or the other. So when you have political economy uncertainty either, well, I mean there are always three outcomes. Either the uncertainty persists, and that's essentially part of 2019. Remember, the original Brexit date was March, end of March. And it's good news that there wasn't a hard Brexit in March 2019. But, of course, in the absence of knowing the final outcome that is a source of uncertainty. The trade disputes and so on have been ongoing, the time by which these will be resolved remains unclear. I remember, this time last year when the deal between the United States, Mexico and Canada was emerging: that was an upside risk. I mean that could have gone differently. So let's see what happens. I'm impressed by how the staff go about their forecasting exercise. They have no incentive either to be excessively optimistic or pessimistic in terms of their own professional standards. But there are clear downside risks. And we can all probably have different views about how likely those scenarios are.\\nSpeaking of policy response tools, there's a global conversation among the developed world central banks right now about the efficacy of their tools. Your response: a 10 basis point cut, a modest uptick to restart QE. But the tiering is something that seems in its early days to be playing out with some unanticipated consequences and in parts of the eurozone it seems to have the- to be viewed as effectively a rate increase, and you've got an incentive for bank arbitrage rather than providing funding for the real economy.\\nLet me address the tiering issue in a minute, but before I get to that, this issue about effectiveness. It's very important to put the deposit rate cut of 10 basis points in the context of the forward guidance. And you also have to be able to reconcile what is the connection between these policy moves and the underlying reality, both in the euro area and here in the United States. We've had this really big move in long-term rates over the course of 2019. So if you believe monetary policy had no impact on financial conditions, it's hard to explain why bond yields moved so much this year. I mean, to a degree of course there's risk premium and so on, but the market understands and you can see it in the forward rates, the market understands that we have the capability. As of now we've got the rate where it is, but we clearly signal that, if needed, if there's further downgrading of the inflation outlook which is perceived to be persistent and requires a response, we can do more. So when we think about what matters for the real economy - the lending rates that banks and other intermediaries offer to firms and households - it's not just the short-term rate, it's the rate they expect this year, next year, over the next five to ten years. And when they know that we have the capability to push that even more negative, and the capability through the APP to compress the term premia we are seeing - and this is why the package is there - we do of course study whether this is passing through to the real economy. Are we seeing the lending rates come down? We are, and we know that the financial conditions, in all the data we have, absolutely do move the dial in terms of consumption, investment, pricing pressure and so on. So our assessment is that our tools remain quite effective. Of course, it's quite different now compared with 2014 when, on top of the normal transmission, you also had the issue about financial frictions. In the same way, in the United States they had this consensus that the most powerful quantitative easing programme was when the mortgage-backed securities market was broken in the United States back in the crisis. So we don't have that, but it's still the case that we assess that these are quite effective tools.\\nIf I come to tiering- Of course, for those involved in interbank markets and so on, this is something that has led a lot of people to study this. The bottom line is that tiering was calculated based on six times required reserves. This leaves a lot of excess liquidity. When you've got a lot of excess liquidity left over, essentially all of the economics, and all of the evidence from every money market you can look at, says that the interbank money market rates will be anchored by the deposit rate. So when this is announced, and maybe in some segments when, as you say, banks are trying to calculate what does this mean in terms of my position and so on, we could perfectly understand and anticipate some degree of trading between those banks with a lot of excess liquidity and those banks which don't have six times required reserves in terms of liquidity. But this is, if you like, \"infra-marginal\", it's not the marginal trade that matters. The marginal trading is what matters for pricing and for financial conditions. If there's some degree of trading across banks to optimise these liquidity ratios, that's just part and parcel of the dynamics of money markets. But it's a sideshow. We of course have read some of those reports as well. It really is the case that, in the vast majority of money market segments, there's complete pass through. You can find semi-traded low liquidity minor segments which, temporarily, may have had partial pass-through, but in the grand scheme of things this is a minor issue; there's been complete pass-through.\\nIs it your expectation that tiering is going to be successful in buffering consumer rates from unwanted outcomes?\\nThe motivation for tiering is, essentially, in a world where- I wouldn't want to take a position about the extent to which banks can pass through negative rates to depositors. But to an extent there is some friction where the net interest margin is compressed - they can't fully pass through these cuts to depositors. The role of tiering is to basically strike a balance, where the ability of banks to sustain credit is what we care about, we don't take a direct view about what's in the interests of bank shareholders, that's not our concern. Our concern is whether there are risks to the credit transmission channel. By tiering, by providing some relief in terms of the net income effects of our policy moves, we think it gives protection against any risk to the credit transition channel. It's not the case that it's a situation about making a call about what type of depositors should be protected. Banks may do so, in terms of their own strategy, in terms of who they want to protect and who they want to pass the deposit rate cut through to. That's a commercial decision.\\nOn efficacy of tools, I believe the latest TLTRO auction at -50 attracted almost zero bids. We also had a fairly hefty prepayment of bonds coming due, so you actually had balance sheet shrinkage in the near term. Do you expect that to be corrected? And to what degree do you expect it to be corrected with the resumption of the APP?\\nLet me make two points. One is that the recent TLTRO take-up was based on submissions before the policy move. So it is nothing to do with the new policy because the submissions came in before we made our announcement. I think what's important with the TLTRO programme is that it's a facility. The most obvious interpretation if there's a low take-up is that financial conditions are so great that there's no need to come to the ECB for funding. It's always been the case that TLTRO take-up has varied quite a bit across banks depending on their ability to raise money cheaply in the wholesale markets. So I wouldn't draw a direct conclusion. We do expect a significant TLTRO take-up over time based on current conditions, but the degree of take-up is not in itself an indicator of the policy stance., because if the reason why TLTRO funding is not taken up is just that they can raise a lot of cheap wholesale funding, the same outcome is delivered - we're making sure that financial conditions are so accommodative that banks are able to pass on cheap funding to the real economy.\\nTurning to inflation, is there an argument to be made that, in December last year, inflation, the outlook at 1.8%... What is it with you central bankers where you want to treat the inflation target as a hard ceiling and you begin withdrawing liquidity as you approach it? Isn't the natural response then to begin retreating from it, as we've seen globally in developed economies?\\nIt's very important to say that the way the APP works is, basically, mostly through a stock effect. And remember we are reinvesting. So the way I would think of the decision last December to stop net purchases is not to start- it's the end of loosening. So, in other words, if you say we're going to maintain this stock at roughly 2.5 trillion, and you're reinvesting, that is not a tightening because you're basically saying we have loosened conditions so much, we want to maintain this super-easy monetary policy. So it wasn't a tightening move at all. Tightening would be to do balance sheet contraction plus lifting policy rates. It is basically saying we think the amount of loosening is now where it should be. We're going to preserve it; we're going to preserve this super-loose condition. What we've done now is we've had a revision, a review - well actually maybe we need it even looser. And that's a reasonable reaction function. When you have the inflation forecast going from 1.8% to 1.5%, you can't be indifferent about that. That's a significant move and the world needs to understand that we will be responding to these significant downgrades by making sure the monetary conditions are sufficient; to make sure the momentum of getting inflation back towards our target is restored.\\nYour observed inflation, though, is even further off target than the Fed's. What gives you the confidence that you can, that there's the lift there to get it back up?\\nThe cornerstone of persistent inflation pressure is what's happening to wages. A big fraction of the overall cost base of the economy is going to be the total wage bill. Unemployment in the euro area has come down a lot; it's now in the sevens. The history of the euro area is that when unemployment gets into the sevens then the labour market gets hot enough that we're seeing nominal wage increases of the order which, if they are passed through, we will have inflation back towards our target. What's interesting is we are now happy with the wage dynamic. There was a period when unemployment was so high, and then when unemployment was falling, that there wasn't much by way of wage expansion. Now, in the last year or two it's significant. We are seeing wages growing, but with the uncertainty we think there are understandable reasons why firms, for now, are absorbing those cost increases in lower profit margins rather than passing through to prices. So under the forecast where we expect the labour market to continue to strengthen, there is significant momentum in inflation. The remaining issue is if the trade uncertainty, the geopolitical uncertainty is lifted, and we think- The history of squeezed profit margins is that it doesn't last forever. Eventually, because of the economics of many industries, firms have to raise prices. So we do think the basic inflation mechanics remain as usual and it's just important in this period of below-target inflation that we address it through easy conditions.\\nIt's a Philips curve argument and here it's been debated ad nauseum for the last couple of years why we're not seeing a sufficient response in the United States to wage growth that has been north of 3% annually for the better part of a year. Are you miscalculating where the natural rate of unemployment in Europe is? You're at 7.5% now, does it have to be substantially lower before you're going to be satisfied?\\nIt's the same attitude here. If we are - and that's a good news story - if we're saying, in fact, the European economy can sustain even lower levels of unemployment, this is fantastic. I mean the fact that Europe, which historically has a high unemployment problem, can sustain much less... So if you ask me, if it takes longer to hit the inflation target because the labour market turns out to be much stronger than you thought, fantastic. People say if they look historically, and if unemployment is at this level, historically interest rates should be higher than they are now. So we're not going to have a kind of fixed coefficient model, where we say unemployment is this, so that means we set the interest rate at X. We are saying that unless the inflation pressure is there we have to keep the monetary accommodation as extensive as required. So it is kind of unchartered territory to see unemployment come down so low without inflation, but that's not bad, that's good. But it does require central banks to respond to that, to make sure- Because the idea that this good news story about our strong labour markets is inconsistent with delivering the inflation target, that would be a failure by the central banking community. The central banking community has to make sure that its policy levers are set to make sure inflation does get to target in this new world of better-performing labour markets.\\nSo that's a \"lower for longer\" argument?\\nIt's a very interesting phrase; you get this phrase a lot. But let me come back to the forward guidance. I'm not making a call about how long this is going to take, because you've talked about downside risks but it's also the case that everyone's really bad at forecasting. You know narratives take hold - lower for longer, slow growth - and then some positive surprises can happen. There are obvious political economy surprises - if there's a good Brexit deal, if the trade disputes find a resolution. Then, also in the real economy, it also depends on the rate of technological progress and other elements, which we are saying, we are noticing globally, that the very strong tech cycle that was there in 2017 has weakened, and again maybe there's going to be a new impetus in some of the drivers of the world economy. So our forward guidance is essentially \"state dependent\", because I've an open mind about whether the world will unfold in a positive way and this narrative will be reversed very quickly, or whether the world will be in bad shape and we will have to respond to that. So I know everyone in all communities likes to latch onto phrases, and \"lower for longer\" is definitely a popular phrase but I wouldn't be fatalistic about it, because it does depend on important policy choices - going beyond the policy choices central bankers make. Obviously there's trade policy, fiscal policy and so on.\\nThe Fed as you know is in the midst of a year-long framework review, looking at the efficacy of tools, new ways of communicating, new ways of setting inflation, expectations and targets - and potentially price level targeting and averaging inflation. Is the ECB due for a framework overhaul?\\nI think it could be good timing. It's been 16 years since the ECB did a strategy review. Most organisations have a fixed calendar. Every three years, every five years there's some commitment as an organisation to do a review. Now of course if you go back to 2003 when the last review was done and if you roll forwards five years, it's 2008. There were natural reasons to postpone the strategy review. And it's been essentially a situation where the scale of the global crisis, the scale of the European crisis was such that this has been perpetually delayed. But I think now it makes sense. It makes sense now when there's new leadership, when there's a correlation. It makes sense also to learn a lot from what the Fed is doing, so there's been no decisions made but in terms of expectation, I think there's a strong expectation that some kind of review will be initiated, sooner rather than later.\\nDo you think it's realistic for the ECB to entertain a different way of approaching its inflation target? Structurally there are clearly differences to the United States, but what about something that is more overtly symmetric allowing it to \"run hot\" to make up for a decade of cold?\\nThere's a lot in what you said there. So this symmetry debate, we have tried to clarify it, because we said in our July monetary policy statement that we view our inflation targets as symmetric. That we will be as energetic- When you go back in history, in the first years of the euro the big impetus was on convincing everyone that the ECB would not be soft on inflation. Many countries had a history of inflation above 2% and so the main impetus was on making sure everyone understood that above-target inflation would need a response. Now in recent years we have the symmetric problem, which is when we are below the target. And going back, from 2014 onwards it's been clear that the ECB has been a leader in innovating in monetary policy. Because of course the Fed has done many things, but in terms of the nature of what the ECB has done, it's been quite aggressive in dealing with below-target inflation. So as for symmetry, I think symmetry is there. Now there are other elements as to how do you reinforce the inflation target, especially when you've spent a long time away from it. The Fed had a review and there have been many, many studies looking at the pros and cons of make-up strategies of different types. And of course we would have a lot of people looking at these as well. Let's see what comes out of the Fed review - it doesn't hurt us that the Fed is ahead of us, because we can learn a lot from what they conclude. But of course I think we have to have an open mind. In the end I would share the same general view, which is central banking by and large has a common technology, it's a common set of challenges and my bet is central bank strategies will be broadly similar around the world. Of course we do have to recognise the United States is much more of a market-based financial system. In Europe banks play a bigger role and, at the level of detail, that matters. In the grand scheme of things we had this tremendous convergence in central banking towards inflation targeting - officially/unofficially, flexible/less flexible, so by and large central banks work in very similar ways and I'm pretty sure that's going to continue.\\nBut you're also, Powell has said this, central bankers are feeling they're reaching the limits of what they can do to support their economies solely with the monetary policy levers. You're not getting the response you'd like from fiscal authorities. What would you advise? I mean, in Europe that governments explore finding ways to provide more fiscal support where for more outright spending there seems not to be the willingness? In Ireland you've got a tax regime that I think somebody has called \"Ireland's gold\", or \"Ireland's oil\" and that's a unique opportunity there.\\nSo let me aggregate to the euro area. So it's very important to understand the history of the last 10 years. If you compare what happened in the United States and what happened in the euro area - given the nature of the national problems in Europe, with fiscal unsustainability in some countries, with market speculation and so on - what you had after the global financial crisis was a significant period of austerity in Europe. In the last two or three years, after a lot of consolidation by governments, there's been a degree of relaxation. So fiscal policy in terms of the rate of growth of public spending has started to be visible after a long period of, basically, being held at zero or slightly negative. So when the private sector is doing well, the ability to run the economy with either neutral or tight fiscal policy - I think the room was there. When you have a slowdown, as we have now in the euro area economy, it varies by country - and fiscal policies are a national decision. So what each country should do needs to respect the individual circumstances. But essentially the way I would view it is that the central bank has to take macroeconomic conditions as it sees them, and especially when the private sector is facing challenges, the overall macroeconomic environment will be heavily influenced by the fiscal choices. And in Europe there are various countries with strong fiscal positions. Some of these countries are also facing slowdowns. So if the goal is to stabilise output, having countercyclical fiscal policy is important. And so of course with a greater contribution from government spending the macro environment will improve and in turn that's going to influence our monetary policy decisions. So I think it's important to make sure that the current debate is primarily about stabilising the business cycle and the text books say fiscal policy can play a countercyclical role. Historically it hasn't always been like that. Sometimes it's been procyclical. Austerity during the crisis was procyclical in many countries. But now, when fiscal policy is in better shape, the room to be countercyclical is there for those countries which do have their public debt in a good situation and have a good starting position. So what we are saying, and we said it in September in our policy statement, is in these contexts moving fiscal policy from generally neutral, or slightly easy, to a bit more countercyclical will be helpful.\\nBut in the two economies I think seem to have the most room, Germany and the Netherlands, there seems to be no willingness - particularly concerning the political will in Germany.\\nI don't particularly want to comment on individual governments, but now in the autumn is when the 2020 budgets are set. So I don't think there have been any final decisions made. Let me also observe that of course there's a difference between the United States and Europe, which is that by and large in European countries the automatic stabilisers are stronger. There are bigger public sectors, tax revenues are larger. And so when there's a slowdown there's automatic easing. I think in many countries to penetrate what is the cyclical fiscal stance requires a bit of work, because you may have a central budget, but then you've got all sorts of different dedicated funds. So let's see what the decisions are this autumn. But I think for the ECB we have to be clear that we are saying that the macro situation means that a macro view of fiscal policy would suggest that, in some of these countries, a countercyclical stance would contribute to a better outlook for the euro area and their national economies, and in turn for the euro area.\\nMoving a little bit on to trade, do you see Trump's approach to trade negotiations, trade policy, as a policy shock? This is effectively Mark Carney's argument.\\nAgain, I don't think it's for me to comment on individual strategies. But the more general issue is - I think there's a high consensus - over the last several years, something that was basically unprecedented, which is the multilateral trading regime, when that comes into question, for many businesses it's really hard to make serious investment decisions. Because, having spent many years building global supply chains, for multinational firms having spent many years assuming they can organise their global activities on the basis of a fixed regime, that is now in question. All I can say is, no matter the identities of who is making the decisions, in itself the uncertainty is a problem. And then in itself, if the final outcome is essentially increasing frictions in the world economy, that's not welcome from an investment point of view. So let's see what happens.\\nWould you agree, though, with Trump's premise that China's trade relationship with the world had to be dealt with at some point, and is it potentially even worth a recession to bring that to resolution?\\nAgain, I don't think I want to comment on US political economy. But more generally, my understanding is that part of the range of issues are to do with trade per se. And then there's other issues to do with intellectual property rights, other elements which can be handled in different ways. Of course, the world evolves, it's not the case that you go forever without any revision in either trade regimes or other multilateral understandings, so let's see what happens. But I think the uncertainty in itself, if it continues to be prolonged, it's a problem.\\nYou're about to get a new boss. As she's been on the circuit this week talking about clouds on the horizon, trade is obviously a big concern for her. How involved is she with you now and getting to be where she officially takes office?\\nNow is late September, so she has a month before taking over on 1 November. I mean, we made this big decision in the September meeting. There will be a monetary "

This will be the last time I speak to you in my official capacity.\\nI would like to take this opportunity to look back at what all of us here have accomplished during those 10 years.\\nWhen I say \"all of us\", I do mean everyone represented here today.\\nUnder conventional wisdom, our relationship is not designed to be friendly or close. We all know that there is potentially going to be some sort of friction between the regulator and regulatees.  If there were no friction, at least one of the two sides would not be doing their job properly.\\nBut if we succeed in working together, we accomplish something of vital importance. We ensure that Hong Kong can fully trust the financial services that you provide and which keep our economy going.\\nToday, I want to look back over the last 10 years and see how well we have all done. And I would like to offer some ideas of the regulatory challenges facing the banking industry in the years ahead - and how these relate to the wider economy and the community.\\nLooking back\\nMy first term as chief executive of the HKMA began 10 years ago this coming Tuesday. That was around two years after the US subprime mortgage crisis had broken out, in 2007.\\nObviously, Hong Kong was affected. The local community was especially shocked by one side-effect of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy - and that of course was the Lehman minibonds episode.  In this whole climate of crisis, public trust in the financial services industry had fallen.  It was a challenging time to step into the chief executive's office.\\nI do not want to spoil a very enjoyable lunch - so I will not give you a long list of the measures and initiatives the HKMA has introduced over the last 10 years. At a rough estimate, we issued an average of around 70 circulars a year during this 10-year period.  I am sure you all remember them very well!\\nFor me, the most important work has been in addressing several broad themes, which to some degree overlap. These areas are:\\nbasic monetary and financial stability - the HKMA's core mission;\\nthe capacity of our financial services industry - specifically the ongoing upgrading of competence and skills, which I like to call the \"soft power\" of the industry;\\nthe issue of financial inclusion - how we make sure the financial services industry serves the whole community, including those market segments that may be less profitable;\\nthe role of technology - a fast-changing aspect of how we all do business, which brings huge potential benefits, but also some serious possible threats;\\nand the overall concept of culture - the individual and corporate qualities without which there is no trust and the system fails. These include qualities like integrity, honesty, openness and respect.\\nI would like to go over these areas - not just to look back at what all of us here today have achieved, but to think about what lies ahead.\\nMonetary/financial Stability\\nI would like to start with our core mission - the stability of our monetary and financial system.\\nMany of us here today are old enough to remember times when Hong Kong suffered a serious currency crisis, as well as bank runs and bank failures. To the younger generation, this is hard to imagine.\\nI will not go into detail about the Linked Exchange Rate System today - I will just say that currency stability is something the whole of Hong Kong takes for granted. It is a fundamental priority of the HKMA to ensure that the community can have full confidence in the system.\\nConfidence in our banks is also key to the functioning of our economy and society. And our work in this area in the last 10 years has affected all of you here today.\\nI think the most high-profile example is the loan-to-value ratio and debt-serving ratio limits on property mortgage loans. The last 10 years have seen strongly rising property prices, and competition between banks has been fierce.  To some observers, including home-buyers, mortgage caps seem like a nuisance and make it harder to buy a property.  But to the HKMA, it is an important matter of credit risk management and the stability of the banking system.  We call these measures \"counter-cyclical macroprudential\".  And it would be highly irresponsible of us if we did not impose these limits.\\nThis is also the case with Mainland-related lending. You all know the ways we have stepped up our supervisory efforts in this area, to ensure credit underwriting standards and risk management.  As with property lending, the basic principle is \"prevention is better than cure\".  To take one example, we are collecting granular data from banks more frequently, to help identify emerging risks.  As with mortgage caps, this might not please everyone - but it serves the wider public interest.\\nMore generally, we have been implementing Basel III. It goes without saying that Hong Kong, as a major financial centre, will comply with international regulatory standards.  Implementing Basel III has been complex, and it has involved extensive consultation exercises.  As with much of our work, your feedback and cooperation have been invaluable in this process.\\nDespite all our precautions, we can never totally rule out the possibility that an institution might have a crisis. I think it is true to say that Hong Kong is as well-prepared, if not better, than any centre in Asia.  One reason is the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance, which came into effect in 2017.  This is not something most of the community thinks about.  But I am confident that we have the tools to handle a bank failure in a way that best serves the overall interests of stakeholders, including the taxpayer.\\nOur regulatory work has not hindered banks from exploring new opportunities and adapting to change. During the last 10 years, we have seen the volume and complexity of offshore Renminbi business increase significantly.  We have also embraced - as a regulator and as an organization - the need to address climate and environmental risk through green and sustainable banking, responsible investment and capacity building in green finance.  And then there is the fast-changing use of technology - which I will mention later.\\nSo overall, I am pleased to say that our banking sector today is safe and resilient - probably more so than at any time in Hong Kong's history. Among the buffers Hong Kong banks have built up are a capital adequacy ratio of above 20%, and a liquidity coverage ratio of above 150% - well above international standards. The classified loan ratio is just 0.56%.  \\nAt the same time, with a return on equity of 13% last year, the Hong Kong banking industry is also among the most profitable in Asia.\\nCapacity\\nNext, I would like to look at the capacity of the industry - skills and training.\\nIt is not a coincidence that one of the financial industry's main professional bodies - the co-host of today's gathering - is the Hong Kong Institute of Bankers, which was founded back in 1963 to enhance the profession.\\nEverything in the financial services industry goes back to people. Since the financial crisis 10 years ago, we have seen a significant increase in the complexity in capital, liquidity, risk management and other requirements.  On top of that, we have rapid developments in technology and related areas like cybersecurity.  The industry has to constantly upgrade its professional expertise and standards just to keep pace.\\nBut unlike some other financial sectors, our regulatory framework for banks focuses on authorizing corporate entities. There is no formal licensing regime that applies to individual banking practitioners.  Our approach has therefore focused on encouragement and guidance - and to benchmarking.  Looking back on my time at the HKMA, I am especially pleased with our work in launching the Enhanced Competency Framework (ECF).\\nI am also glad to see the industry and our educational institutions cooperating to create new degree and post-graduate level courses in financial disciplines.\\nI think this whole \"soft power\" area is one where the regulator and the industry are very much in agreement. The HKMA has not seen a need to impose mandatory qualifications for banking practitioners.  Through encouragement and cooperation with the industry, we have achieved our essential supervisory aim of ensuring that our institutions and industry are sound, stable and reliable.  In addition, we have worked with institutions to enhance Hong Kong's competitive position.  For example, I like to think that our ECF programmes in AML/CFT and in private wealth management have helped to enlarge and enrich Hong Kong's talent pool in these areas.\\nPeople and soft power remain a top priority. Hong Kong's competitiveness in financial services essentially rests on the quality of our people.  The upgrading of skills and the development of talent are the foundation of Hong Kong's future as an international financial centre.\\nInclusion\\nIt is very nice when both the HKMA and the banking industry have broadly similar interests, as is the case with professional skills. But, inevitably, our aims do not always coincide.  And this brings me to the next area of my discussion - and that is \"financial inclusion\".  In other words, ensuring that the banking industry caters fully to the needs of the wider economy and community, rather than focussing purely on the most profitable activities and market segments.\\nHong Kong is a capitalist, free-market place. But the regulatory authority works not only for the industry but also for the public.  And our population has a keen sense of community and fairness.\\nIn the last 10 years, anyone concerned with public policy, corporate governance and business regulation has noticed rising expectations of good corporate citizenship. I took over as Chief Executive of the HKMA just a few months after the SFC and HKMA pushed through a solution to the Lehman minibonds episode.  I think everyone learned some valuable lessons from that.\\nOne market segment we need to consider is the elderly and low-income retail customer.  \\nSome of these retail clients obviously have limited savings to deposit and limited banking needs, and the reality is that they will not provide banks with much fee or interest income. However, the community expects banks to provide them with basic services, essentially on a pro-bono basis.\\nSome of them have difficulties using technology, and cost-saving service-delivery channels such as ATMs, online banking or mobile device. We could try harder to persuade - or even compel - the elderly to adopt modern technology, in the name of efficiency or modernity.  But as I say, Hong Kong is a compassionate community, and we need to be in step with those values.\\nWe will probably need to consider a similar tolerant approach in future with small businesses that are perhaps slow to adopt e-payment systems.\\nThat brings us to the overall segment of start-ups, and companies moving into Hong Kong. These clients have complained a great deal about the difficulty of simply opening corporate accounts.\\nThese complaints were potentially affecting Hong Kong's reputation as a welcoming place for business. We took this very seriously, and we believe we managed to sort out some of the underlying problems.\\nBut this is a classic example of the dilemma we all face - as industry players and as the regulator. We do not want awkward due diligence and know-your-customer procedures.  But we cannot accept the reputational harm and the other possible costs if one of our leading banks cuts corners and is then found to be handling funds from illicit activities.\\nThis challenge - balancing risk - will continue.\\nTechnology\\nPerhaps the main possible solution to the problem of growing complexity is technology. And that brings me to my next subject.\\nMost of us here can remember when basic online banking was a novelty, and how we faced new challenges in cybersecurity. In the years to come, we are going to see continued transformation.  We have already issued licences for eight virtual banks.\\nI believe we are only just starting to see the beginning of this. The future could be one where physical bank branches are just a memory - like public telephones on the street.  Artificial intelligence (AI) will lead to all sorts of possibilities in terms of client-behaviour and data analytics, and probably in areas we do not even anticipate.\\nThe potential is in some ways very exciting, but it also raises all sorts of concerns. Cybersecurity and data privacy are ones we all already face.  But what about the possible implications for risk management?  We do not know where new technology might lead us - so by definition we cannot predict what the risks will be.  And what about the human factor in the relations between banks and customers?  An AI system may be very smart, efficient and accurate - but will it have an understanding of morality?  Can it make the right ethical judgement?  Can it have a sense of fairness or decency?\\nI must be honest and say I cannot answer these questions. But it is clear that new capabilities for technology will require new capabilities from people.  The industry could be entering a very different dynamic, where what is now a decade of change takes place in a year.\\nCulture\\nThis is going to put new burdens on all of us. I believe that, more than ever, we will need a basic sense of purpose to help us keep everything in perspective.  That brings me to my last subject - that of culture.\\nSuch qualities as integrity and respect are essential to maintain the community's trust in the financial system. And, to be honest, this is one area where the HKMA cannot impose its will on banks.  We can push banks to do many things - but cannot enforce morality.\\nI am always reminded of the words of Baroness Onora O'Neill - the British academic and philosopher. She said, I quote, that \"overuse of regulation leads to the formula 'legal equals right'\".  In other words, if the industry focuses only on complying with HKMA rules and statutory laws, it will assume all other possible behaviour is legitimate and acceptable.  In short, banks will look for loopholes.\\nOf course, that is not the case. It is banks' responsibility to instil a culture of prudent risk-taking, an ethical approach to business, and a focus on treating clients fairly.\\nThis is partly a matter of example within the organization - by top-level attention at board level, good corporate governance, and by not encouraging short-term risk-taking.\\nThis is not simply about complying with HKMA directives, or obeying the law. It is about bankers being aware of their personal responsibilities as custodians of the public's trust, and as citizens.  We cannot do this for you.  I am glad to say, looking back on 10 years as chief executive, the Hong Kong banking community can take pride in honouring its commitments and deserving society's trust.\\nConclusion\\nLadies and gentlemen, we at the HKMA - and all of you in the banking industry - have been through a great deal in the last 10 years. I have mentioned just a few of our many challenges, and our achievements.\\nAs I said at the start, Hong Kong's monetary and financial system is probably as secure as it has ever been - even though the infrastructure and markets are far more complex than ever. The Hong Kong banking industry is world-class in terms of its skills and people, in its dedication to inclusion, its preparation for technological change, and its awareness of the need for integrity and values.\\nBut we must all be very clear that maintaining the quality of the industry is a never-ending task. Looking back, I am proud of what we have done collectively - but I know there will be much more to do in future.\\nHong Kong at the moment is going through some troubles. But experience and history show us that Hong Kong overcomes problems, pulls together and moves on to the next stage of its development and success.  I know that the banking industry will make a major contribution to that process.\\nThe opportunities for our banking sector are opportunities for the whole of Hong Kong. From the changing economic role of China and the Asia Pacific, to the rise of new technological applications - these are going to be very exciting times.\\nI would like to close with a personal note. All of us, in the HKMA and the industry, have achieved a great deal over the last 10 years.\\nThis would not have been possible without the dedication, expertise and integrity of the HKMA's own management and staff. They are a credit to Hong Kong.\\nBut at the same time, we could not have done it without the professionalism of all of you in the banking industry. So I would like to thank all of our friends in The Hong Kong Association of Banks and the Hong Kong Institute of Bankers.  Your constructive feedback and positive attitude to our relationship has made our mutual success possible.\\nAs I say farewell, I trust that our collaborative relationship will continue, to the benefit of not only the banking industry but the whole Hong Kong economy and community.\\nI wish you all the very best for the future. Thank you all very much."

        "title": "Mario Draghi: Interview in the Financial Times",
        "content": "The following is an edited transcript of the interview.\\nYour new headquarters is very impressive.\\nYes and it is also symbolic as it embodies our values. Transparency and independence.\\nWhat is the legacy you feel you leave behind?\\nThe ECB's response to the crisis was crucial in preserving the euro and keeping the European Monetary Union together and always respecting its mandate.\\nFurthermore, the ECB is nowadays a very different institution from the past. The existential challenges that it had to cope with have profoundly transformed it both as far as monetary policy and other key tasks are concerned, but also in its managerial and operational structure. Finally, there is a clear message now that can inspire future work on strengthening our Union. Without a significant fiscal policy for the whole of the Eurozone, this Union will remain a fragile construction.\\nBefore you became ECB president, you were in Frankfurt often as governor of the Banca d'Italia. Did it strike you before you joined the ECB that there needed to be the sort of changes that we've seen you make.\\nThe extent of the crisis was clear to me. The contagion had spread throughout the euro area periphery, the banking crisis was peaking with bank runs pushing some banks to the brink of failure, dollar liquidity was insufficient. But as soon as I moved here the policy analysis was wider. The scope of possible actions is much larger than at the national level, the initiative to act springs from this.\\nWithin a few weeks of moving here you took your first action when you cut rates. What were those first few months like?\\nThere is a wealth of information that you have access to only from here. Everything pointed to a situation that was spiralling downward.\\nWe had been in a crisis, then we seemed to have done slightly better by the turn of 2010. By the end of 2011, the credit flows to the private sector were dropping dramatically. The economy was already shrinking. There was also evidence of sovereign and bank contagion.\\nIt was a natural response to immediately lower interest rates once and then a second time, and then introduce the LTRO. The LTROs were not completely without precedent, there had been similar longer-term credit lines. The difference was that these were for three years, and the terms and conditions were much easier. The collateral rules were changed too, some of the earlier experience showed that with certain collateral rules these credit lines might not have been accessed.\\nYou didn't necessarily expect to become the ECB president.\\nNo.\\nIt was a twist of fate. Were you ready for the job?\\nI don't know. Up to others to judge.\\nDid you have a plan?\\nI had been governor for six years. I was chair of the FSB, previously the FSF. But did I ask myself, 'Am I ready? Do I know the nuts and bolts?'; no, I haven't asked myself these questions.\\nBut you did have an unusual array of experiences: financial markets, central banking experience, treasury, international, economic policymaking, and regulation. It's pretty formidable. But on the other hand you were Italian.\\nI don't think that ever played a significant role in this. But I should say that the six previous years I had spent in institutions like Banca d'Italia and the FSB, the latter of which had led the regulatory response to the great financial crisis at a global level, were a good preparation for chairing the decision-making process of the Governing Council.\\nAs a president, with extensive discussions with the staff and the ECB chief economist, one gathers a deep view of the whole Eurozone, encompassing national views. Bringing this to the Governing Council, together with the collegial exchanges - where participants may be expected to change their minds if facts warrant it - is of utmost importance. That's why it's essential that participants should not have dogmatic monetary policy views that cannot be adapted when the facts warrant it.\\nI think this method worked really well. Of course it becomes harder during a crisis, especially in a heterogeneous zone like the Eurozone, where you have countries that have been doing - by and large - well throughout the crisis and other countries that have done very poorly.\\nYou said we were heading into a crisis pretty fast by the time you took over. So at that point you had to draw up a strategy.\\nA crisis so dramatic required a powerful monetary policy response with all the then available instruments, including non-conventional ones.\\nBetween February and March 2012, through the three-year LTROs, we avoided a major banking crisis in the Eurozone which would have had devastating effects in many countries in the Eurozone, and we had to face resistance and criticism even at this early stage.\\nTell us how you got consensus.\\nThere was no consensus. These were all majority decisions, but there was a very clear majority since the beginning.\\nDid that worry you; that you had a rump set of dissidents?\\nIt would have been much better if we had had unanimity from the outset. Once I understood that was not going to be the case, it was a necessary price to pay. This was not without consequence. The prior universal view was that the ECB was fundamentally a very conservative central bank. So, it took some time before expansionary moves could be viewed without a certain degree of scepticism. But this only reinforced our determination.\\nThis view - that we could not act without unanimity, especially at times without the largest member countries - played a bigger role at the beginning. But then, especially after the London speech was welcomed by the majority of the Governing Council, this view faded away. The London speech was a defining moment for that reason too.\\nWhen investors came on board; yes. How much time did you actually try to spend convincing these dissenting voices?\\nTime is always necessary, especially when the waters where the Governing Council was to navigate were unchartered. And my colleagues and I still spend a lot of time discussing where we go, what we want to do, and so on.\\nWhat was - in your view - your decisive argument?\\nMy argument was that they should try to see that this is not a one-country world, that this is a more complex reality than just one country. And monetary policy should be designed accordingly. I think this is the key.\\nOf course that's the central story in European integration, isn't it? A figure like Helmut Kohl certainly understood that this was not a one-country world, in the very telling phrase you've just used.\\nYes. He certainly did, as does Chancellor Merkel.\\nSo was this an institutional mindset or a national mindset?\\nThis mindset is the product of success. You had a prestigious institution, the Bundesbank, with a successful monetary policy 20 to 50 years ago - when almost everyone else in the world was making one policy mistake after another. But with the euro we had entered a new world. And this world was changing fast.\\nFurthermore, after the great financial crisis the Eurozone had low inflation and the highest level of unemployment, probably since the Great Depression. The financial system became fragmented and monetary policy was no longer effectively transmitted. In those years, changes in interest rates would no longer be transmitted into lending rates to the private sector.\\nYes, this is why new instruments were required.\\nThis is why new instruments were required. It was a world where we went very close to the brink, where even the institutional setup, our monetary union, was put into question. Of course this picture was made even more complex by the fact that this was not true everywhere. In some countries, both the banking and financial system continued to work, but in another part - a big part - of the monetary union, they didn't. It was definitely a new world.\\nWho were your most important allies at this point? We all need friends. We all need people who are empathetic.\\nFirst, most colleagues in the Governing Council, otherwise I wouldn't have had a constant large majority for eight years. Second, the leaders of Europe with their continuous understanding of the gravity of the crisis. Third, the supporting opinion of most economists and policymakers, especially the ones who had gone through similarly difficult situations in the US, UK and Japan.\\nThe European Council has always been quite supportive. I'm regularly invited and I am asked to give a presentation of the economic situation of the euro area and on occasion they could have made criticisms - after all, some finance ministers were not shy of making clear their viewpoints. Never in the European Council; I don't think I remember one occasion when there was even veiled criticism towards our policies.\\nSo was there a tacit deal with Berlin that you can be criticised in private, but in public whatever you say is fine?\\nNo, there was no deal, either tacit or implicit. There has been a completely independent relationship. Never a quid pro quo.\\nIf you look at the evolution of this crisis, though, it became a sovereign debt crisis and so then you were faced with even more critical decisions with at least one member state in grave peril and in fact the Eurozone as a result in peril.\\nThe debt crisis had already exploded before my coming here. Then we had Greece, which again went close to default in 2015. On that occasion again the ECB was pretty successful in taking a policy line that maintained the unity of the euro while preventing blatant violations of the Treaty at the same time.\\nWe had two sets of diametrically opposed criticisms there. One was that we should have cut Greece off any line of financing immediately, which would have implied the full collapse of the Greek economy and likely exit of Greece out of the euro; and the other one saying that we should have provided unlimited, unconditional liquidity to the Greek government and the Greek economy no matter what.\\nThe support given to Greece was substantial. At its peak the combined lending of the ECB and Bank of Greece to Greek banks reached \\u20ac127 billion or 71% of the country's GDP. We did this while the first group of critics was suggesting we should have cut all lines immediately. We continued to finance the private sector with safeguards to make sure that there was no further financing of the state. There was no monetary financing. It was all in all the right way to go because we managed to both keep the euro intact and also avoid circumventing the Treaty.\\nAs Peter Praet reminded us at the time, this implied two major changes to the governance of ELA interventions: first, the duration of assistance lengthened; second, the scope of assistance broadened from individual institutions to entire banking systems.\\nYes. It was a real balancing act; a tightrope act.\\nYes. It was not easy at all.\\nDid you do a study, though, on the consequences of Greece leaving the euro?\\nOur job is to look at contingencies. But let me be very clear, on the euro, there was no Plan B.\\nWhy?\\nBecause the ECB has been created with the mandate to maintain price stability and price stability is founded on the existence of the euro. Otherwise it has no meaning if there is no euro. Which price stability or which currency are we supposed to maintain? The dollar? No. The pound? No. It's the euro. So that's why there's no Plan B.\\nIt's good to hear that. But on Greece clearly there was quite a bit of pressure to say, you know what, let them go.\\nYes, but I did say this openly in a Eurogroup to a minister who was suggesting or hinting that we should have cut them off a long time ago. I said: 'Look, if you want to push Greece out of the euro, you do it. Don't use the ECB to do it.'\\nBasically that was calling their bluff.\\nWhat do you say to those critics, some of which are in the UK on the left, who say Greece has paid a terrible price for both joining the euro and indeed staying in the euro?\\nThe country was coming from an unsustainable debt financed bubble. The collapse was extraordinarily large and the crisis was terrible. It was overcome first thanks to what the Greek citizens had been able to achieve. But solidarity in the Eurozone has been beneficial. It is very difficult for an isolated country which defaults to go back to normal. The euro area actions have helped Greece, which grew at 1.8% on average over the last eight quarters, with income per capita, after falling roughly 23% from 2008 to 2016, now growing again at 1.6% in 2018, and private investment resuming.\\nCan we go back to this famous dramatic event in London? History has been rewritten, hasn't it? Because you didn't actually plan to say it like this.\\nWell history did turn out differently from what people in the room expected. Some of that had to do with the sense that the overall situation was very serious. Spreads everywhere had widened. The exchange rate was depreciating not because of any other reason than a lack of confidence in our ability to act decisively. The financial system and banking system were widely fragmented.\\nIt was quite clear that much of this was the outcome of a crisis of confidence in the euro. It had to be addressed. It had to be reverted. I was adamant about that. There had been preparatory work in the bank along various lines of possible action.\\nThere had also been steps forward in the previous European Council in June with the launching of the banking union which, together with the just established European crisis mechanism and improved economic governance framework, strengthened EMU. Though these decisions certainly helped, and in fact were mostly based on proposals made by the ECB in the previous three years, the substance of the London speech was fully independent of the Council decisions. There was no deal.\\nSo there had been a remarkable display of unity by the leaders in taking actions that would eventually make our monetary union stronger.\\nSo to be clear, you did intend to make some kind of statement.\\nI had reflected, consulted and deeply thought about the appropriate message. I knew I had to make it absolutely clear that the ECB would do whatever was necessary, that only bringing certainty to markets that the ECB was unwavering would put a halt to the downward spiral. I was determined to make that point forcefully. And the markets did the rest.\\nSo once you'd said this and it had a market reaction, did you have a clear plan then of what you were going to do to back it up?\\nA strong commitment to intervene in an unlimited fashion supported by an equally credible commitment of the country concerned. Given the experience with SMP, that commitment needed to be clearly spelled out and backed by a programme with the then EFSF, now the ESM.\\nThe sense is now that it has acted as a nuclear deterrent. You never really needed to draw on it because markets find it so convincing. Were you convinced yourself at the point you created it that markets wouldn't test it?\\nThe second meeting was in early September. Then we were ready to be tested. The continuation of the favourable market reaction in my eyes showed that it was really a crisis of confidence that we needed to address.\\nYes. That was the genius of it. Did you figure that it might have a chance of working that way?\\nThe message was expected to calm the markets, but I also knew this message would be sustained if the countries undertook reforms needed to cement those lower spreads and to produce sustainable growth.\\nAnd of course OMT was crucially upheld in the court.\\nThat pronouncement of the ECJ confirmed the legitimacy of our actions.\\nTo call a cat a cat, if you're looking at your tenure do you think you've had any impact on German public opinion? Well, the ECB. Let's not personalise it.\\nThe behaviour of the ECB during the crisis, the fact that after so many years we're still together, that the economy has now fully recovered of course helped.\\nI would never miss an opportunity to say, employment increased by almost 11 million in less than six years. In the euro area we lost fewer jobs in the crisis and then created more new ones than was the case in the United States. And Germany, the country where our conversation is taking place right now, is actually doing not only better than many others but very well in absolute terms and the best in 40 years. In fact, Germany's real GDP growth, on a yearly basis, has been positive for 24 consecutive quarters and the unemployment rate stands at its post-unification historical low of 3.1%. Germany recorded both the lowest overall and youth unemployment rates in the euro area. Employment is at an all-time high with 45 million in work in the first quarter of this year. With the labour market becoming tighter, wage growth has picked up more dynamically in the recent years, supporting domestic demand.\\nThe euro is as popular today as ever before in its 20-year history.\\nI've lived in Germany myself for two years. Why does one hear so much dissent on monetary policy?\\nThis reaction, which contrasts with the general approval that our measures received in the rest of the world, might partly be explained by the novelty of our measures, and partly by the way central banks' communications channels work in the eurozone. Banks, insurance companies, pension funds, business models and savers' behaviours needed to adapt to QE and negative interest rates and this wasn't easy. We were fulfilling our duty; the Treaty is asking us to take the actions we are taking to preserve the stability of the euro.\\nAlso, explanation of our policies to the citizens of the eurozone relies on national central bank communication. Whenever they supported Governing Council decisions at national level, public opinion at country level was also supportive. Once a decision is taken, dissent should stay within the Governing Council.\\nWe need to talk about today. First of all, if you look at your ammunition chest, how much have you got left?\\nAll instruments from interest rates to asset purchases, to forward guidance are ready to be calibrated. We also need to reiterate that we are symmetric in pursuing our objective, i.e. that to keep inflation above our target as much as below it.\\nAlso, in the future, if the experience is telling us anything, it is this: we have to have a fiscal policy of some significance in the Eurozone. The first time I mentioned this was in a speech I gave in Jackson Hole in 2014 and I repeated it thereafter several times. I always mention the fact of the need to move from a rules-based national fiscal policy to an institution-based fiscal capacity. We have countries that have fiscal space and don't use it. Even if they were to do something, what would be useful to the rest of the euro area would only be the spill-overs. This means that steering the aggregate euro area fiscal stance in an optimal way through decentralised policies is difficult to achieve given that national policies are geared to national stabilisation needs. Furthermore what is clear is that the current composition of euro area fiscal policies is not optimal. Countries with fiscal space could use some of it to strengthen public investment and increase their growth potential. Member states with high debt with few exceptions are not building buffers needed to provide fiscal stabilisation during the next downturn.\\nSo Mr Macron is right to call for a common European budget?\\nMonetary policy can do its job, but in the absence of a stabilisation capacity it will only do it more slowly and with more side effects. A combination of monetary and fiscal policies might have delivered similar results on growth and inflation, but faster and at a higher level of interest rates.\\nIt needs to be complemented.\\nYes it does.\\nThat's crucial. That's the huge lesson, isn't it? That's your message in Sintra, but is it politically feasible? How do you get around the German objections?\\nThis is certainly valid. This objection has been there now for many years.\\nTry 25 years.\\nThere are no lasting monetary unions without fiscal risk sharing both because convergence cannot be perfectly achieved and because regions may be subject to idiosyncratic shocks. Mundell and Bordo have provided extensive evidence that fiscal policy is indispensable to monetary unions. This may be another long journey, perhaps as long as the journey towards the euro was, because of the present political difficulties. But fixing a long-term roadmap to that objective would send a powerful signal that would strengthen the euro area and may even provide additional policy space.\\nYes. I've read the speech twice and it's very good, but this fiscal point is crucial. Do you think a new generation of leaders is required to accept this?\\nAt some point they will have to ask themselves the question. I'm convinced that this is an existential part of the euro area that needs to be completed. We can have a long transition. I'm the first to say, transition is bound to be long and it may evolve in ways that we don't know. Presently even a roadmap may be too much, but a long-term political commitment is essential.\\nNow, at this point, Jacob Rees-Mogg says, 'I told you so, it's the United States of Europe, it's federalism'.\\nThere are lots of other things that still remain in the national remit.\\nIt's still a hybrid.\\nLike all unions. Given the inherent weakness of nation states in a globalised world, what matters is to make the union stronger. In some areas further integration achieves this goal, in others, it is the preservation of the national identities that serves the purpose.\\nYes, because this is coming from a central banker who has managed existential crises. But do you think a majority share this view in the council on the fiscal capacity question?\\nIn the Governing Council we discuss monetary policy not fiscal policy but my guess is that many governors would share the same viewpoint. In the European Council they discuss fiscal policy and the last Five Presidents' Report offered some thoughts on this.\\nThere's a serious point here about what you said in Sintra. You clearly say, we've been flying almost on one engine, right?\\nYes, definitely. Everything becomes more difficult.\\nWhat do you think, then? Nobody knows what the next crises are, but could things get even rougher in the next phase?\\nFrom an institutional point of view the EMU is stronger than it was before the crisis. We have the banking union, the capital markets union, and so on. Also the economy is now doing better and most of our risks are produced by events that are taking place outside the eurozone, think about trade disputes, Brexit, geopolitical tensions, where we are on the receiving end. Of course, we have our own political fragilities, as one would expect from a union with nineteen democracies.\\nDid it worry you when you were attacked by Trump the other day?\\nNo.\\nDoes Trump worry you?\\nI was not worried.\\nBut in general, this has been the most extraordinary period where the central banks have actually had to rescue the system, so to speak, and we've had this persistent low inflation. Inflationary expectations are lower than just before you launched QE.\\nYes.\\nSo the question is, how do you get out of this deflationary mentality and indeed the low interest rate environment?\\nThe answer is to persist with monetary policy. Although, as I said before, fiscal policy could greatly help. We mentioned maintaining the extraordinary stimulus, and this may have to last a long time if there is no support from fiscal policy. Having said that, inflation expectations are actually going down everywhere.\\nThere is a structural component which keeps inflation low because otherwise it would only be a eurozone phenomenon. I'm not saying this with any degree of complacency, by the way. We've got to continue being persistent, patient, prudent.\\nThe situation is improving, nominal wages are now growing at an annual rate of 2.3 per cent for the euro area and more in certain core countries. This sooner or later will translate itself into higher inflation. It's just taking longer than we thought.\\nDo you still think a hard Brexit is a possibility?\\nIt would not be for me to venture into hypothesis, but simply if you compare the likelihood of hard Brexit today with what it was four months ago, one has to admit it has gone up.\\nIt has gone up, but there's no Plan B. Or is there?\\nWe have addressed all the possible contingencies within our remit and we worked extensively for three years with the Bank of England. But of course being such a broad-ranging event, risks remain.\\nJust in terms of the populist climate, there does seem to be a common vein that they are attacking central banks and attacking central banks' independence. What do you do in response to that?\\nCentral banks were made independent because independence is the pillar of their credibility. The best response is therefore to continue to pursue our mandate. If central banks deliver what they've been tasked to do, that's the best answer to some of these concerns. It is also essential to explain better and better what we do. Communication again.\\nFrankly I think it would be a mistake to reverse central bank independence. I've lived in periods when central banks were not independent and it was definitely worse.\\nSo I've got to find a way of asking politely, all great leaders think about their succession-Yes. It's a political decision, but how far do you feel what you say and do now is in effect intended to exert influence beyond your tenure?\\nSuccession is a fact enshrined in the Treaty. Decisions about it are a political task. My duty is only to continue to serve the mandate until the very end of my term.\\nSo just thinking ahead, if you had to identify the two or three things you're very concerned about now and possibly contingencies, what would they be?\\nGrowth has weakened in most advanced economies, especially where trade and manufacturing are important, such as Germany and Japan, with GDP growth projected to be at or below 1% in both countries this year. Global trade volume growth has slowed abruptly, from around 5.7% in 2017 to around 1.4% in the first quarter of 2019, in year-on-year terms. Near term trade prospects remain weak.\\nGood. Can I ask you a parochial question? What is the impact going to be of Britain leaving the European Union politically and economically?\\nIt's going to be a loss for the European Union from all viewpoints and I think there is nothing more to add to that.\\nIs it going to change the geopolitical dynamics?\\nToo difficult to guess which way.\\nThere are still some concerns that when you depart, when another person is sitting in your chair, that the market might pay more attention to them having to operate 'within our mandate', rather than your willingness to do 'whatever it takes'. So is the OMT watertight? Do we have a true lender of last resort facility for the Eurozone or do you still need a safe pair of hands in Frankfurt and in Berlin and other European capitals?\\nYes OMT is watertight, as well as other key decisions taken by the Governing Council during these years. Of course, all policy decisions depend on the circumstances, but I have no reason to think that people who will be sitting in those chairs in the coming years will interpret the mandate in a way different from what the Governing Council that met in the summer of 2012 actually did.\\nWhat is your opinion on the nomination of Christine Lagarde as your successor? Is it a disadvantage that Ms Lagarde has no formal training as an economist?\\nShe will be an outstanding ECB president and I say so with full knowledge, having known her for longer than she and I want to remember. She has successfully led the IMF and its staff of economists through challenging times. Also, there are many similarities between the way decisions are taken at the ECB and at the IMF. As I said earlier in our discussion, work at the ECB is collegial, relying on extensive discussions with the staff and the chief economist, as well as the rest of the Governing Council. This is not so different to how the IMF works. Ms Lagarde and the ECB are very well equipped for the next eight years.\\nThere is a growing feeling that central banks, including the ECB, have shouldered too much of the burden and can no longer be the only game in town. Is the era of the omnipotent central banker past its peak?\\nI talked about fiscal policy as a necessary complement to monetary policy since 2014. Now the need is more urgent than before. Monetary policy will continue to do its job but the negative side effects as you move forward are more and more visible.\\nThe ECB has undershot its inflation target much more than other central banks. Why is that?\\nHave we done enough? Yes, we have done enough - and we can do more. But more to the point what is missing? The answer is fiscal policy. That's the big difference between Europe and the US.\\nThere has been a backlash against the most recent package by some of your colleagues. Why did you want to do such a big package? The bigger the package, the bigger the reaction?\\nDisagreements about policy happen everywhere, not just in Europe. The outlook has worsened, especially for manufacturing. Inflation was no longer on track to meet our target. And our policies will continue to work, albeit at a slower pace than if governments were spending more.\\nOn the euro, the house is still standing but it is a bit rickety.\\nThe house is not rickety. What I see looking back is progress on banking union, on capital markets union - but EMU is still incomplete.\\nIt just needs a new extension?\\nTo have a stronger EMU we need a common eurozone budget. Clearly the political debate on that still has a long way to go. But I am optimistic. Many more people understand the importance of these reforms than a few years ago - there will at some point be a commitment.\\nYou don't think we could go backwards?\\nNo. People have understood the benefits of the single currency. Trust is going up. The opponents of the euro have not succeeded."

        "title": "Philip R Lane: Q&A with Bloomberg",
        "content": "The following is a transcript of an on stage question and answer following Mr Lane's speech, Reflections on monetary policy.\\nI did take the precaution of inviting mainly economists today, so I think they will have found your speech very exciting and interesting. Whether a broader cross-section of London would have had the same reaction, we don't know, but it doesn't matter. You've often said, particularly in times of unconventional policies, how important communications are for monetary policy. A lot of the communications that we've been talking about over the last few days, since the package was announced, have been negative communications from members of the Council who have made very clear their opposition to at least one part. In some cases that's been - the criticism and the opposition seems to have been - not just from what you might call the usual suspects. Are you worried that the amount of talk about that opposition has distracted from the package or limited its usefulness in the short-term?\\nLane: Of course it's natural, every central bank that I know of does a range of these different views at the moment. How do you deal with below target inflation? So if you look around the world, this debate is everywhere. It's about the imperative to move as quickly as you can to reach the inflation aim versus recognising side effects and so on and maybe having a different view about how quickly and how proactively you should respond. So it's natural that the same debate would also be taking place among the members of Governing Council. I think the fact that there may be, as you say, there's been, an open reflection of that, to me is quite healthy. It's saying that the discussion we have is serious, all points of view are discussed, but in the end the decision is made. So more important than the noise about the collective decision as embodied in the introductory statement versus the fact that there's a range of views around that is: this is the decision; this is the decision when we move these levers and provide the decision about forward guidance. That's the core to communication - we are clearly communicating about the current policy path, the current decision about APP and the forward guidance.\\nOf course, future Governing Council can revisit this decision. But this decision was made and as the President said last week, no vote was necessary, there was a sufficient majority to back this decision. In the same way, at the Fed or Bank of England, there's not that many votes that are unanimous. There will be differences of views and the European Central Bank making a significant decision in line with its mandate, I think is - I don't disagree it's novel to have this amount of discussion - but that reflects the nature of this world we're in, the seriousness of the issues, and there are important points of view on all sides.\\nBefore, we were talking about companies and we were talking about governments, we often talk about the principle of collective responsibility. You can have lots of debate beforehand, but once the decision is taken, the perception is that it's costly to have noises off and continued criticism. Would you say it is unhelpful from now on if people continue to state their opposition?\\nLane: No, I think I disagree. So first of all, there's a high degree of consensus about needing to act. The detail of how you assemble the package is secondary. The most important message, which is also reflected in the July statement, is: the current situation is not satisfactory and we need to act. That is the most important message. The fact that there's a difference of views about how you use each lever is maybe secondary. I think it would be fake to supress the fact that it's a range of views. So I'm okay with open disclosure of different points of views.\\nThere has been sustained opposition to that particular part to quantitative easing by at least one important member of the Eurozone for many years. We're used to that. Do you think long term it's sustainable to continue with a policy that is opposed by two of the most important countries in the Eurozone? Is that undermining-?\\nLane: I'm very glad you asked the question because it's very important to remember: everyone on the Governing Council is there as an individual. So the way you phrase that suggests there are national points of view, which there are not. It's very important that we recognise everyone there at the Governing Council is making an assessment of what is a good idea for the euro area. I don't - we don't - think of it like that and I don't think it's a good idea to frame it in that way. But let me emphasise, as you indicated, it's possible to have a view of especially sovereign purchases from a philosophical point of view. It's also possible to have it from a tactical point of view, as in do current conditions warrant it or not. Clearly, there are individuals in either camp.\\nMaybe coming back to the chart I have shown about the ten-year rates [Chart 13]): we have seen this big move this year. Interpreting the big move this year, does that mean financial conditions are easy? Or does it mean there's been a downward revision about future prospects for the world economy, where if we didn't respond to that downbeat assessment by demonstrating our willingness, our imperative, to move policy rates in the right direction? I think that's part of the intellectual debate.\\nWell, to get to that debate, if you compare the current restarting of bond purchases with the beginning of 2015, when it began, at that time the headline inflation was negative, the confronting of a compelling deflationary threat. Some of the criticism would be: you've taken QE from being something for special occasions to an everyday conventional policy by doing this in response to a relatively small change of conditions.\\nLane: Let me answer first of all, the way to think about the change of conditions for me anyway. If I go back to December last year, where we ended the net APP, the projected inflation rate for 2021 was at 1.8 %. In the most recent release it's 1.5%; that's not a minor movement. So when you have a big movement of 1.8% to 1.5%, then you have to respond. Essentially, in that situation when we are in an unconventional space - the deposit rate is negative, APP is an unconventional instrument - and the question is - in a world where there clearly is discussion about negative side effects from either instrument - operating at both margins from one perspective is safer and more effective than loading it all on same - the deposit rate. So I wouldn't say we're normalising the APP because we're far from a conventional environment right now. This programme now is a re-opening. It's not some radical change of attitude. The conditions in which we shut the programme of net purchases last December are not conditions we face now. So the fact we've reopened an existing programme I don't think is a very dramatic decision.\\nWhat is the impact? You talked in detail, and have in the past, about what the impact different elements of the package might have on prospective inflation and expectations. Taken together, what is your estimate of the impact this will have on inflation in the forecast horizon?\\nLane: First thing that's important to say is - because there's a lot of debate about the effectiveness out there, and our staff, we've a lot of staff working and the calculations are with the updated data - it remains the case, both instruments, both moving the deposit rate more negative and increasing stock of APP are effective. They pass through, we see it in the data. They continue to pass through at the lower level of lending rates facing firms and households. In turn, all of our models do say lower lending rates and firms and households do stimulate investment and consumption. So the effect, that we've assessed these tools to continue to be effective\\nAs effective? Sorry, just to put in diminishing returns, you might say they're effective but not as effective.\\nLane: Let me come back to one element of that in a minute. Of course, the overall impact we assess as significant. We wouldn't do it if it was basically invisible in the data. We do think this will visibly move the pathway for the outlook of inflation, but of course it's hard to demonstrate. There's a whole range of different techniques: you can use structural models, you can use data models, you can do different ways of tackling it. Across those rates of models, we're convinced that this will have a sufficiently significant positive contribution to inflation. It makes sense to do it.\\nComing back to the diminishing returns, everyone agrees: QE has a different mechanism when there's a financial crisis. Whether it's the Fed's purchase of mortgage-backed securities during the crisis, whether it's the 2014/15 intervention in the euro area, when there were a lot of frictions in markets, clearly that mechanism had a powerful effect because you're getting rid of frictions. But let me emphasise: even after those frictions have greatly diminished, as in the last recent years, it remains the case we visibly see an impact of APP on the funding costs of corporations, the funding costs of banks and in turn to the lower funding costs of banks, to the lending rates charged by firms and households. It remains quite effective and again even this phrase - I read it all the time - \"diminishing returns\", compared to the peak impact when you have a financial crisis, it's less. But I'm not so sure it's continuously a sloping function that it's continuously edging towards zero.\\nJust to distil it into the basics, you talked about how this was a significant change in the forecast that had produced this change. The change was a reduction in the forecast on the order of 0.3. When Mario Draghi says last week, \"this is sufficient\", that's because the ECB believes, all other things being equal, this will have that order of effect on the forecast, 20 or 30 basis points.\\nLane: I'm not going to disagree with that estimate, but I don't want this to focus on one particular number, because obviously it depends on the model you use. It depends on ancillary assumptions, but that order sounds okay to me.\\nWhen you say you don't want to focus on one thing, what therefore people want to understand is: what will you be looking at if you're putting everything on the future, on the assessment of the robust return to inflation close to - at target or close to target, what else should we be looking at? What constitutes a robust convergence?\\nLane: I don't think it's too complicated to work out what these phrases mean. Because by way of contrast, by way of a counterexample, you can have flat-out convergence in the inflation outlook, meaning you can see a surge in the target. You can see headline inflation could be quite persistent but not in a robust way, because it would be driven by some disruption in oil markets, you can see those sometimes, or other disruptions that come out of the markets. So you can see a non-robust convergence because of what's happening with the model components. Robust, basically we understand as: this is not for a quarter or two quarters, this is going to last.\\nThe second part of the guidance is that it's basically aligned with the realised path, the underlying inflation dynamics, because you could possibly, you don't want to have a modelling error where you see the economies would take off like a rocket and so you say inflation is going to accelerate really sharply. I'm sure models exist that would have that feature, but given the persistence of inflation, which many models don't fully capture, we are saying we also need to see actual inflation, the outcomes, especially across the indicators; especially we need to strip out the volatile elements sufficiently in the neighbourhood of where you want to get to. Everyone's going to agree: yes, it's credible to say compared to where we are now, these forecasts you have, this outlook assessment you have is credible.\\nIn order for rates to go up, you have to be forecasting inflation targets however you're interpreting it at that point, and that has to be a credible forecast given that-\\nLane: So, some people will say - you think - that the jump is too big. So, if inflation today is low and you forecast a high number two years from now, it's fair to say, well, we've not seen it. We're seeing inflation move maybe sometimes in an incremental way. So the connection between the outcome and the forecast is basically saying there's a modelling error and maybe it's safer to wait until the actual realised inflation is not too far away.\\nIt's fantastic to have this conversation with you, just a few days after this major event, so thanks again for coming here. I know people in the audience are going to want to ask questions. I have a couple more things. When I listen to Mario Draghi and particularly the tone of the conversation around fiscal in the last couple of months, which has been slightly different from even his previous comments, and I look at your very explicit charts about the effect on the output gap in the Eurozone, it seems to me that the ECB is saying: when it comes to next responding to the ups and downs of the cycle, potentially downs over the next few years, fiscal is the new monetary. Is that right?\\nLane: I don't think that's the way to think about it. I've skipped over it, as I was conscious it was running a bit long - but in the concluding section of the speech, which I'm sure is online by now on the ECB website, I do emphasise that our mandate is unconditional. We will do what it takes.\\nWhatever?\\nLane: Whatever it takes to get through to inflation and align it with our targets. So we are not saying that fiscal is the new monetary, far from it. We are making the empirical point that the macroeconomic environment we face does depend on fiscal strategy, and more broadly the policy strategy, because part of what's confronting Europe is a slow potential growth rate. So some elements are about what kind of reforms, what kind of bulk investment will allow greater optimism about the long-term future? But there's also a cyclical element, which is what that chart was conveying [Chart 17], which is - retrospective, looking backwards. We all understand the reasons why we had this pro-cyclicality through the crisis. With the rebuilding of fiscal balance in recent years, fiscal policy has been neutral and a little bit expansionary. What we're saying in the statement last week was that from a cyclical point of view, we are showing here that we will provide more accommodation.\\nObviously, the pass-through - and this goes back maybe to what you asked me about the mapping for the inflation outcome - it obviously depends also on what's happening with other policy levers, especially fiscal, so the impact of our policies on inflation does depend on the fiscal decisions. Now in September, governments across Europe are actually making decisions about their 2020 budgets and so it's good timing to point it out. Now again, this is essentially making an empirical point. It's not our role to set fiscal policy. It's just the empirical point that under these conditions - if you're facing a slowdown- It's a differentiated message - saying to governments facing the slowdown and that have fiscal space in this world: the fiscal multiplier is probably quite high, given the flat interest rate environment.\\nWe are also saying: where there are still fiscal targets to meet, countries continue to need to be prudent and to maintain their structural targets. Now of course, structural targets allow automatic stabilisers to work around those. So we think this message should be fairly straightforward to understand, this basic statement.\\nIt is straightforward, but of course there's also a lot of nervousness around crossing lines or further blurring of lines between fiscal and monetary policy. As far as you're concerned, in the most recent statements and what you've just said, has the ECB gone as far as it can go on the spectrum between encouraging expansionary fiscal policy and explicitly underwriting it, if you like - which people would be very nervous about, potentially? Legally, do you think you could go any further in terms of specificity?\\nLane: I'm not so sure that's the way I would think about it. I don't think I've been in and had such kind of a conversation in the ECB. It's basically a reminder of the situation, which is: we have a weak economic outlook; we are responding to that. But the mapping of our measures to the overall economy and to inflation does depend on what's going to happen and the decisions made in terms of setting fiscal policy now. I don't think it's anything like a deep philosophical issue. Of course, there's lots of debates going on in the world about monetary-fiscal interactions. It's much more confined than that.\\nI'm dying to ask more but I know there's lots of frustrated people wanting to ask questions! I'll take a few.\\nQuestion 1) You've done ten basis points of rate cuts. You've done \\u20ac20 billion of QE. That's in the context of 350 to 500 basis points of rate cuts and \\u20ac2.6 trillion of QE. Some people might argue that's tinkering at the edges. If this didn't work and it didn't prove to be the panacea, what new tool might you add to your monetary toolbox?\\nQuestion 2) You have made a big point now and also in the Helsinki speech about the negative rates being important because you have to have a symmetry of expectations. Since last week, the market has very strongly repriced the expectation of the effective lower bound. Is this a concern; that effectively the market seems to have concluded that really it will not go much lower than that, hence it's not so symmetric anymore?\\nQuestion 3) Just a very short one. This is just a quick clarification question: in the past statement and your speech, you say net asset purchases also continue to run before you start raising the key ECB policy interest rates. Now, that's a plural; interest rates, so does that mean it will be the point at which you raise both the depo and the MRO rate? Or is it just the depo rate until the asset purchase will run?\\nQuestion 4) A question on, there is a slight contrast in the guidance on rates and QE and the guidance on rates explicitly allows for cutting rates further. The guidance on QE doesn't mention the potential for upping the pace of asset purchases. Does that imply that the hurdle to increasing that pace as you have done in the past is quite high this time around?\\nLane: To the last point, I'm pretty sure in the statement, the generic couple of sentences saying we stand ready to adjust all of our instruments as needed. So you're over-reading, I think. Equally, you're over-reading, I think [on question 3]. Remember now we have a TLTRO rate as well. So when we think about the multiplicity of rates, you have many different rates. So it's just seen as correct English to say the key ECB interest rates - it's not some encoded signal about the MRO.\\nThe whole question of how we think about the market reacting to our policy moves in turn begs the question: how do we think about the run-up to the meeting? How do we think that policy rates move beforehand? I don't particularly think we're like that. Obviously, next time we have the possibility to look and review. Trying to calibrate exactly - these are market-determined rates - so trying to exactly hit some perfect yield curve is not how we think about it. So I am not overly tracking the short-term movements you mentioned. Because I would like to conclude that what we saw before the meeting, already the ten days before the meeting, there'd been quite a lot of movement.\\nSo to us, it's really- I tell you how the forecast process works, is essentially all of this converts into an overall picture. The big impact on the forecast is through lending rates. So we'd be looking at where are lending rates to the real economy? How are they responding to what's happened? That's really a big driver of the macro-forecast for the outlook of inflation. I know people in the market have a concern about all of these different segments, but I'm not overly concerned. What we do - so as policymakers, as the Governing Council - we're focussed on what is the toolbox relevant for today. Like any central bank, plenty of research is going on, on everything. Plenty of studying, everything that's happened elsewhere, everything that could happen. So there's no shortage of study about alternatives, and going back as you know, we're clear: our mandate is not sometimes you should hit the target delivering your mandate and sometimes you shouldn't. We have an absolute mandate.\\nQuestion 5If you could elaborate a little bit more on the issue of symmetry, because first of all I notice in the last statement it wasn't as prominent in the one before.\\nSecondly, you said earlier that symmetry refers to a determination on both sides of the inflation goal or inflation aim. When you read Mario Draghi's Sintra speech, I think we could even read a time element in it, so if inflation is below the target for quite a long period of time, it could probably be above it also for quite some time.\\nQuestion 6) I have a question about the leadership and whether this policy that seems designed to tie Christine Lagarde into a continuation of QE when she comes in and also potentially how you will look to work with her, obviously with her experience as well.\\nQuestion 7) I had a quick question regarding the limits on bond holdings around PSPP in particular. You've gone with the \\u20ac20 billion per month option, which is actually an option that is, as you mentioned, feasible in the long run without increasing the limits. You have really mentioned this potentially change now at the last press conference. Does it mean you have given up on it; it's no longer legally feasible, in your opinion?\\nLane: Okay, the first question, symmetry. I think one element is defining symmetry and the way we communicate about this - i.e. policy - really basically we will be as reactive below the inflation aim as we would be above. So it's basically saying the size of the reaction is the same, whether we're below target or above target, which I think needed clarifying, because given the price stability definition is zero to two, we kept on seeing people interpreting our inflation aim as asymmetric, because they confounded the aim, which was below but close to 2%, with interpreting some kind of hard ceiling there, too, which is not the case.\\nNow, how do you communicate that? How do you convey that? How do you make sure everyone understands that? So in the Sintra speech Mario Draghi gave the example of one way he could do that is through overruns to match previous underruns and that's also in the Fed review now. There's a lot of interest in make-up strategies and so on. As President Draghi said last week, I'd imagine it's quite likely we'll get a strategy review at some point. That's a kind of question about, how do you communicate and deliver that symmetry? What kind of measures would you use?\\nThe prominence in the statement I think is a relevant issue. We had a lot to pack in last week, while in the statement in July there were no policy moves. So symmetry is very important. Of course, we had many things get covered in the statement last week.\\nThe Governing Council, this year - I might be wrong - but I think someone told me out of 25, there's 13 turning over this year, so there's a lot of turnover. The Governing Council has to operate on a continuous basis. Even without last week's decision, because forward guidance is a big part of the machinery, because we have a big stock of accumulated assets, any new President is going to inherit a policy position. So I'm not so sure, and I know it should be well understood that, of course, the President has a key role, but in the end the Governing Council operates as a membership between equals, and I would share with everyone else looking forward to working with Christine Lagarde. I think she's going to be an excellent President of the ECB.\\nOn the limits, again going back to: you make decisions when they are salient; and there's a decision that we assessed. Given the situation that I think applies, the \\u20ac20 billion would be a good number; and because our calculations mean it doesn't cause an issue with the limits for an extended period of time, there's no particular reason to address that issue now. As you know, it's an ongoing tension between- there's very good reasons to that limit. On the other hand, if it interferes with the delivery of price stability then you'd have to look at that, but it's not immediately relevant for us. We think this - the \\u20ac20 billion - can be handled within limits for an extended period of time. We think it's enough to lift the pathway for inflation.\\nAs you know, there's lots of different estimates going around. When you say extended period of time, as far as you're concerned that's well over 18 months?\\nLane: I'm quite reluctant to- - again because it goes back to everyone's opinion about how much debt is going through the mix between sovereign and non-sovereign elements with the programme. So I think we're happy enough that for an extended period of time, it is quite a long time, we can buy. I have read some people in this room write only a short period of time, which I would disagree with. Extended.\\nYou know who you are! We promised we'd finish actually rather earlier than this, but I think it's been great to have such clarity on the policy introduced last week. I guess I've got a final question, which is: have you spoken to Christine Lagarde about monetary policy since she was appointed, or ever, for that matter?\\nLane: We've had discussions in the past, when she was head of the IMF and I was governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, but not recently, no.\\nDo you see a process where you'll be talking to her more before she comes in?\\nLane: Sure. I imagine now that she's finished with her duties at the IMF, the typical routine, for me, there was the lead-in for the month before I started in June. There was a kind of gradual greater involvement in the process and so on. So I would imagine in the coming weeks - especially as the handover looms on the horizon - that there'll be a much greater interaction.\\nI'm sorry that we've begun, and I'm going to end, with what you might consider to be a superficial question about how the Council handles itself, but the people in this room, the era of Peter Praet and Mario Draghi was quite a distinctive one. There was a perception that they were joined at the hip, if you like. Very strong relationship, which then drove policy in a very significant way. When you're looking at that as a potential model for your relationship with the new President, just as an observational matter do you think that's in principle a good model to follow? Or do you think there were potentially - it was very specific to the circumstances and the potential institutional cost to it? How do you think it's going to go?\\nLane: I think I would count myself, and remember also as Executive Board members we are collectively responsible for the ECB. We have a lot of fantastic staff working for us and they're working for the Board collectively. I happen to have the lead responsibility for economics and monetary policy, but absolutely I can only imagine scenarios where in any scenario, the person holding my position and the President will always work in a close working relationship.\\nI should say, Peter Praet was also admirable, at least from our perspective, of the transparency with which he talked to journalists and to economists. I hope this is the beginning of continuing that tradition. Thank you very much for the event."

        "content": "Good afternoon,\\nIt is a pleasure to be here speaking at the Dublin Economics Workshop today, and I especially welcome the topic of this panel - Small open economies - Vulnerabilities in a Changing World.\\nThe concept of openness has perhaps never been so pertinent.\\nUntil recently, the world was broadly becoming more open, tariffs and capital controls were being eased or removed entirely.\\nTen years ago it would have been hard to imagine the rising protectionist sentiment, and indeed actions we see in parts of the world today and the pressures on multilateralism. And while not the focus of my remarks today, this reflects that globalisation or openness can come at a cost, leading to more competition and so creating winners and losers.\\nThis can cause higher unemployment and reduce wages in affected sectors. Indeed it does seem at times that some of the merits of economic openness have been all but forgotten. "

        "content": "1 Introduction\\nDear Chancellor Bierlein,\\ndear Vice-Chancellor Jabloner,\\ndear Finance Minister M\\xfcller,\\ndear President Mahrer,\\ndear Governor Holzmann,\\ndear Ewald,\\nladies and gentlemen,\\nJoseph Schumpeter once said that to realise the relative validity of one's convictions and yet stand for them unflinchingly is what distinguishes a civilised man from a barbarian.1 Ewald Nowotny is an exceedingly civilised man.\\nAs an economist, he is aware that many insights are preliminary and potentially mistaken. At the same time, Ewald Nowotny is, in his charming way, always an independent and ingenious thinker. And as such, he has, for many years, left his mark on the Governing Council of the ECB. After all, of the remaining Governing Council members, only Yves Mersch and Mario Draghi can lay claim to a longer membership. \\nFrom the outset, the years on the Governing Council demanded his full commitment. Exactly two weeks after he took up office as governor of the OeNB, the insolvency of investment bank Lehman Brothers left the financial community in a state of shock. The resolute monetary policy response helped to prevent a worse outcome.\\nSimilarly, the subsequent sharp economic downturn in the euro area forced the Governing Council of the ECB to take unusual decisions. This period was incomparably challenging for central bankers - and instructive for us all.\\nEwald Nowotny has always unhesitatingly shared his wealth of experience with me and others. He has always been there to advise me and other colleagues if we had any questions. For that, I would like to thank you once again most sincerely, dear Ewald.\\nIn all these years, the Governing Council has been able to count on your competence and independent judgement. But why is an independent assessment so valuable, especially in bodies such as the ECB's Governing Council?\\n2 The Jury theorem\\nBack in the 18th century, the Marquis de Condorcet, a French mathematician and philosopher, examined the question of what conditions had to be met for a jury to be more likely than a single voter to arrive at the correct judgement when voting on two alternatives.2\\nIn his important contribution to probability theory, Condorcet showed that if each individual member has sufficient good judgement and decides completely independently, the group is more likely to select the superior alternative.\\nThe British mathematician Francis Galton was also surprised by the potential precision of a \"vox populi\", a voice of the people.3 When he visited a livestock exhibition in 1906, competitors in a quiz estimated the weight of one of the show's oxen. It transpired that the competitors' average estimate corresponded to the ox's actual weight of 1,197 pounds.\\nCondorcet's conditions - sufficient expertise and independent judgement - are often far from being fulfilled. In real decision-making situations, the information upon which members of a group base their decisions is frequently the same, or at least similar. This alone means that their voices are not independent of one another.\\nWhere they are dependent, aggregation in itself no longer guarantees that the jury will tend to select the better outcome. This is because its members may jointly succumb to the same error.\\nAs a consequence, a wide range of ideas, experiences and views is essential if the judgement of a group is to be, on balance, superior to that of an individual. Probability theory has meanwhile shown that a jury is more likely to take a sound decision, even under more realistic assumptions, if its members' outlooks are sufficiently different.4\\nWhat the Governing Council therefore needs is experience and independence of judgement, and that is something Ewald Nowotny has always supplied in abundance.\\n3 Monetary policy\\nIt is especially important to look at data, concepts and potential viewpoints as holistically as possible where uncertainty about future developments is particularly high.\\nLooking at the global and the euro area economy, it is abundantly clear that we are in such a period of uncertainty. The Governing Council of the ECB passed a very comprehensive package of measures when it met in mid-September, which, looked at in its entirety, I believe to be overdone.\\nThe economic situation and the outlook in the euro area are not so bad, wages are rising clearly, the forecast for the inflation rate two years ahead was lowered only slightly and there is no evident danger of deflation, in other words a permanent drop in prices and wages.\\nECB President Mario Draghi has pointed out the divided opinions on the current package of measures within the Governing Council. I consider it not just normal, but absolutely imperative, for far-reaching measures such as government bond purchases to spark intense debate.\\nThe Austrian philosopher Karl Popper once stated that only critical discourse could give us the maturity to consider an idea from more and more angles and to evaluate it properly.5\\nAnd to my mind, the conditions under which the Eurosystem has been buying government bonds since 2015, for example, illustrate how this kind of debate can in fact improve our decisions. During our discussions back then, we drew boundaries in the purchase programme to mitigate the risk of monetary policy being harnessed to fiscal policy.\\nWith that in mind, I hope that the decisions that have now been made do not call into question these restrictions, for example with regard to upper limits relative to a government's total debt or relative to the volume of a single issue, or the principle that purchases are distributed across Member States' bonds according to the ECB's capital key and not according to the amount of government debt. After all, nothing has changed when it comes to the validity and importance of the limits on government bond purchases decided by the Governing Council of the ECB.\\nParticularly in a monetary union where Member States enjoy fiscal autonomy, it is vital to ensure that the line between monetary and fiscal policy does not become blurred.\\nThe central banks' response to the crisis also posed temptations with regard to the Eurosystem, which it should not pursue. To quote Ewald Nowotny: \"A lot is being asked of the ECB [-]. Some of it we can't deliver - because our framework is different to that of the US Fed.\"6\\nThis is of course all the more true of demands such as those espoused by Modern Monetary Theory: transferring the objective of price stability to fiscal policy and making monetary policy, in the role of an agent, subordinate to fiscal policy would be doing a disservice to society.\\nEven though economists in fact disagree about many issues, the notion that independent central banks focused on price stability are good for a society's prosperity is backed up by theory and empirical evidence and enjoys broad consensus.\\nThis is also illustrated by the OeNB's long history. At its anniversary three years ago, Ewald Nowotny stated: \"Yet, irrespective of the challenges the Nationalbank faced at different moments of its 200-year history, the overarching principles of its policy were always the same: the quest for stability, built on trust in the Nationalbank, which in turn is fundamentally linked to its independence.\"7\\nIt is also the shared quest for price stability that unites the members of the ECB Governing Council. I was sorry to note the resignation of Sabine Lautenschl\\xe4ger last week. Her voice was also an asset to the Council and will be missed. The diversity of opinions and perspectives on the Council was always a strength, not a weakness. \"United in diversity\" is more than just the motto of the European Union, which may seem abstract to many. It is also a firm mandate to approach one another and bring people together.\\n4 Conclusion\\nLadies and gentlemen, the links between the Oesterreichische Nationalbank and the Bundesbank are many and varied. In the spirit of friendliness, we hold regular joint meetings of our management bodies and discuss important matters relating to work in the Eurosystem.\\nAnd last year, for example, OeNB and Bundesbank experts joined together to study whether blockchain technology can aid in the exchange and distribution of information between clearing houses in real time. The extensive IT expertise of our Austrian colleagues was especially valuable to the project.\\nI'd like to thank you, Ewald, for the trust given to us in this collaboration, but also your fellow Governing Board members Andreas Ittner, Kurt Pribil and Peter Mooslechner.\\nAnd I'm quite certain that Professor Holzmann, too, will continue in the same manner. I wish him and his colleagues on the Governing Board - Gottfried Haber, Eduard Schock and Thomas Steiner - every success and look forward to future encounters and dialogue within the ECB Governing Council and beyond.\\nEwald, you have embodied an independent monetary policymaker focused on stability. Your experience and clear focus will be a loss to the Governing Council.\\nEven if it's no longer at official meetings, I look forward to hearing your voice in the future as well. Not long ago, you yourself quoted Jean-Claude Trichet's words about central bankers: \"You remain a member of the club.\" We all look forward to it.\\n1 Schumpeter, J. (1942).

        "content": "The resilience of the euro area through many years of crisis has proven its critics to be wrong. Several countries, not least Greece, have undertaken remarkable efforts in order to thrive as members of the monetary union. Important institutional reforms have taken place to strengthen the euro area, notably the creation of the banking union and the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). As I have outlined elsewhere, the euro has been beneficial in many ways, and today the single currency is more popular than ever.\\nBut the fact that the crisis lasted much longer here than in other advanced economies - and came with a substantial social cost - still weighs on perceptions of our monetary union. Have we learned the lessons of that episode? And have we taken the necessary steps to prevent such an outcome in the future? These are the questions I would like to address today."

        "content": "Corresponding author: Claudia M. Buch, Deutsche Bundesbank, Postfach 10 06 02, 60006 Frankfurt, Germany. This text is based on joint work with Manuel Buchholz and Katharina Knoll, both Deutsche Bundesbank. An earlier version of this text has been prepared for the conference \"High Public Debt: Theoretical and Historical Perspectives\" held at Goethe University Frankfurt on May 17, 2019. We are grateful to Puriya Abbassi, Fabian Bichlmeier, Magnus Brechtken, Robert D\\xfcll, Albrecht Ritschl, and Edgar Vogel for most helpful inputs as well as to Janina Berner for excellent editorial assistance. The paper reflects the views of the authors and not necessarily those of the Deutsche Bundesbank. All errors and inconsistencies are our own.\\n1 Motivation\\nCentral banks rely on and play a key role in ensuring the stability of the financial system. Yet, the definition of \"financial stability\" as an explicit policy objective and the assignment of a role for central banks has been a relatively recent development. Financial stability is defined as a situation in which the financial system neither contributes to a pronounced amplification of an economic downturn nor is a source of instability itself.\\nThe specific tasks assigned to central banks have been evolving over time. According to the Bundesbank Law of 1957, the Bundesbank's mandate was rather broadly defined as to \"safeguarding the currency\". Forty years later, in the wake of the evolving European economic and monetary union, the Bundesbank's mandate became focused on \"maintaining price stability\". After the financial crisis, the Financial Stability Act of 2013 prominently provided for the Bundesbank to contribute to safeguarding financial stability."

        "title": "Luis de Guindos: Key vulnerabilities for euro area financial stability",
        "content": "Let me start by thanking you all for participating in this meeting of the Financial Stability Contact Group. These meetings are a key feature of the ECB's market intelligence gathering activities.\\nThe financial stability environment has certainly remained challenging since this group last met in March. The global economic outlook has worsened since then, and political and policy uncertainty has increased in a number of areas.\\nTaking this into account, we continue to see four key vulnerabilities for euro area financial stability: (i) first, a risk of mispricing of some financial assets; (ii) second, high public and private sector indebtedness in several countries; (iii) third, in view of banks' subdued profitability outlook, we see a risk of hampered bank intermediation capacity; and (iv) fourth, vulnerabilities stemming from increased risk taking in the non-bank financial sector. We see the likelihood of these vulnerabilities unravelling in a disorderly manner over the next 18-24 months as remaining largely unchanged. This is because the now widely expected \"lower-for-longer\" interest rate environment mitigates many of the possible triggers for corrections over the short to medium term.\\nLet me expand a little on these vulnerabilities:\\nRepeated downward revisions to the economic outlook and accommodative monetary policy actions on both sides of the Atlantic have put downward pressure on global bond yields across the whole maturity spectrum. For the first time in history, large parts of the yield curve for many euro area sovereign bonds, in particular those issued by governments with high credit ratings, have entered negative territory.\\nIt is often said that low or negative interest rates inflate asset prices as investors search for yield and take on more credit and duration risk. Equity and corporate bond prices, for instance, have appreciated across the globe over the past decade as yields have followed a path of long-term decline. Abrupt corrections, especially in equity markets and markets for lower-rated bonds remain a risk, particularly in the face of high economic and political uncertainty.\\nLow funding costs can encourage firms to increase their leverage, which might intensify vulnerabilities in the event of an economic downturn. This risk has increased as the economic outlook has worsened and the share of triple-B ratings has grown.\\nConcerning the second vulnerability, in several countries debt in the public and/or non-financial private sectors is lingering at levels that are high by historical and international standards. This leaves public and private finances exposed to the risk of a sudden change in market sentiment or deteriorating macroeconomic conditions.\\nThird, parts of the banking sector continue to exhibit weak performance. Banks have improved their capital positions and profitability since the euro area crisis, and the stock of non-performing loans continues to decline at a moderate pace. But further improvements are needed in parts of the banking sector if banks are to achieve sustainable rates of return. In particular, overcapacity and cost inefficiencies weigh on many banks' long-term profitability prospects. The better performance of some banks within the euro area, and in jurisdictions facing similar economic and financial conditions, illustrates the importance of addressing structural issues.\\nThe current interest rate environment has various implications for the resilience of the banking sector. Banks have benefited, and will continue to benefit, from the lower credit risk for borrowers, and from the higher asset valuations associated with lower interest rates and better macroeconomic outcomes. This has helped support bank profitability across the euro area since the deposit facility rate turned negative in 2014. However, the negative interest rate policy also entails costs for banks, and these could increase the longer negative rates are in place, the lower policy rates are set and the larger the amount of excess liquidity held by banks.\\nThese vulnerabilities could crystallize if economic growth is much weaker than expected, or if weak growth persists for longer than expected. We thus welcome the measures taken by the banking sector in recent years to improve resilience, and support efforts to further strengthen resilience while conditions are benign.\\nThere are also vulnerabilities in the non-bank financial sector, which has significantly expanded its role in financing the real economy in the euro area. Total assets held by non-banks have almost doubled over the last ten years, growing from \\u20ac23 trillion in 2008 to \\u20ac42 trillion in 2018, while the size of the banking sector stagnated over this period. Non-banks currently account for around 55% of the euro area financial sector. While a larger non-bank financial sector has the benefit of helping to diversify the funding sources available to the real economy, it may also entail rising risk taking in the current market environment.\\nWe are closely monitoring two developments in this context: first, non-bank financing activity is growing, in particular in higher credit risk corporate financing, where indebtedness is already higher. Second, as institutional investors are searching for yield, they may amplify the cyclical underpricing of risk, potentially also taking on more leverage and liquidity risk.\\nIn the euro area investment fund sector, we have observed increasing liquidity risk for some time. This reflects a falling share of holdings of liquid government bonds and a fall in cash holdings across the sector. We have recently witnessed cases in which funds holding considerable amounts of illiquid assets (Woodford, H2O and GAM - all UCITS funds) faced severe difficulties in dealing with large-scale outflows. These cases had no systemic repercussions - partly because the outflow triggers were idiosyncratic and partly because the market environment was benign.\\nIn a more broad-based market downturn, though, we would be concerned that a repricing of financial assets could trigger sudden and large redemptions from these funds, possibly resulting in forced asset sales, which could amplify stress in less liquid markets. This would have wider implications in the form of impaired market liquidity and possible spillovers to the real economy.\\nWhile leverage in the euro area fund sector is low on average, there are also pockets of high leverage among some types of alternative funds, and these need to be monitored closely. Even if leverage of UCITS funds is not excessive, it can still add to the procyclical selling of assets if a fund tries to keep its leverage constant during periods of stress.\\nI hope that gives you a good perspective on our current assessment of financial stability risks. I look forward to hearing your own views on these and other vulnerabilities for the euro area financial system."

        "content": "Good morning, and welcome to the Federal Reserve Board's research conference \"Nontraditional Data, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing in Macroeconomics.\" Here at the Fed, we are continually assessing the current state of the economy, updating our outlook for economic activity, and estimating the risks around that outlook. In this environment, we assess a broad array of government and private-sector data to determine what they imply for the achievement of the Fed's statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability. As a result, this conference and the range of topics on your agenda for today and tomorrow are highly relevant for us. More timely and accurate information sourced from nontraditional data and the use of new techniques should permit Board staff economists to make better estimates of the evolving news and what it implies for the economic outlook and allow policymakers to make better-informed decisions.\\nOver these next two days, you will hear about the use of new tools and nontraditional data sources and what they say for the assessment of inflation and the labor market; about the use of new methods for forecasting; and about extracting information from text and using textual analysis to evaluate regulatory complexity and understand central bank communications. You no doubt will have many conversations in this room and during breaks about the usefulness of big data and new techniques for macroeconomic analysis. I am pleased to see some former colleagues and important contributors to macroeconomics and measurement on your conference program, such as Erica Groshen; Ron Jarmin; Matthew Shapiro; Hal Varian; and David Wilcox, who recently left the Fed for other pastures.\\nI would also like to acknowledge the diversity this conference offers. This conference is interdisciplinary, bringing together people from many different fields of study-economists, computer scientists, and statisticians-as well as people from many different types of institutions, including universities, central bank research departments, statistical agencies, and the private sector. We all stand to benefit from work across disciplines, and the connections forged at conferences such as this one can be highly fruitful.\\nTo a large extent, the use of nontraditional data, machine learning, and natural language processing in macroeconomics and for policy is only just in its infancy. In many cases, we are unsure of the efficacy or benefits of these approaches. Coordination between statistical agencies and policymaking institutions will help us achieve our shared goal-a better understanding of the economy. To this end, the discussions on the use of big data and new techniques for central banking and on the possibilities for cooperation between private companies and government agencies should be particularly helpful. Moreover, I strongly encourage you to continue your discussions after the conference ends and to seek opportunities for joint work so that we can further develop our understanding of big data and textual analysis.\\nNow I would like to invite the participants in the session on alternative data on inflation and the labor market to come to the podium. Welcome to the Federal Reserve, and I wish you a successful two days."

        "content": "Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.\\nThank you for inviting me to share with you the BSP's key policy issuances and initiatives to promote financial inclusion in the Philippines and the regulatory framework on financial technology. This year's theme \"Get all Pinoys #AcceptED!\" is aligned with the BSP's policy objective of building an inclusive financial system for the Filipinos.\\nThrough financial inclusion, we aim to cater to the unserved and underserved markets such as the low-income and marginalized, micro, small and medium enterprises, overseas Filipinos and their beneficiaries, agriculture and agrarian reform sectors, indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities, among others.\\nWe, at the BSP, recognize the significant role that the fintech plays in driving the transformation of the traditional processes in the financial system through technology-driven innovations to unlock financial inclusion barriers.\\nWe aim to develop a digital finance ecosystem that supports the diverse needs of all users in a manner that is secure, sustainable, convenient, and affordable. To support this goal, the BSP established the National Retail Payment System (NRPS), our flagship program for digital finance.\\nNRPS is built on three core principles namely interoperability, inclusiveness and \"coopetition\".  Through the NRPS, regulated institutions are required to adopt transparent and fair market pricing of electronic payments, transition from exclusive bilateral to multi-party clearinghouse agreements and provide electronic fund transfer facilities in all available channels, among others.\\nIt is a critical platform that will establish an interoperable ecosystem allowing seamless electronic fund transfers and payments between and among accounts. It aims to promote a \"cash-lite\" economy and ultimately improve the country's economic competitiveness.\\nThe NRPS, and the payment ecosystem that is envisioned to arise from it, is positioned to be a platform for fintech innovations. Industry players can utilize fintech solutions and provide services within an organized, commercially-viable and efficient retail payment system.\\nAdvances in technology have also enabled the development of solutions that enhance market reach and expand delivery channels. Through technology, people from all walks of life, including those in unbanked and underserved markets, can have access to formal financial services like online bills payments and fund transfers.\\nWe cannot discount the crucial role that fintech companies play in this modern ecosystem. Fintech players are not competitors of our supervised financial institutions, but rather, are strategic partners to bring about greater efficiencies in the delivery of financial services.\\nRecognizing the benefits and opportunities from these technological innovations, the BSP aims to provide a regulatory environment that allows innovation to flourish, while at the same time, ensuring a safe and sound financial system that is beneficial to the general public.\\nThe BSP's regulatory approach is shaped by three principles:\\nOne - We ensure that regulation is risk-based, proportionate and fair - This simply means that regulation is calibrated according to the magnitude of risks identified in a defined activity, and not on the type of entity that delivers it.\\nThis approach promotes a level playing field and ensures that beneficial innovations are not hampered by unwarranted and excessive compliance requirements.\\nTwo - We maintain active multi-stakeholder collaboration - This is necessary in view of the multiplicity of players and multi-layered relationships among fintechs and varied financial sector players. It represents a \"whole-of-government approach\", ensuring policy consistency and preventing regulatory arbitrage. Continuing engagement with industry players is also crucial to foster a shared understanding of risks, our financial inclusion goals and market conduct expectations.\\nThree - We ensure consumer protection - By this we mean innovations must work for the benefit of consumers, especially the most vulnerable ones, and those availing of financial services for the first time.  Regulations must ensure that issues such as transparency, product suitability, security and confidentiality, are made paramount considerations in the design and deployment of digital solutions.\\nFintech has immensely contributed to the enhancement of a financial consumer's experience by transforming the delivery of financial services from branch banking to online banking, paper-based money to electronic money, and face-to-face customer verification to technology-aided know-your-customer process, among others.\\nIn addition, Fintech transcends geographical barriers and enhances transparency, and reduces the cost of financial transactions.\\nIn line with this, the BSP has identified the responsible promotion of FinTech as a priority agenda, thus, the establishment of a fintech roadmap covering three key areas, namely: Collaborative Engagements, Commensurate Regulations and Capacity Building.\\nBy collaborative engagements, we mean maintenance of active multi-stakeholder collaboration - This is necessary in view of the multiplicity of players and multi-layered relationships among fintechs innovators and varied incumbent financial sector players. It represents a \"whole-of-government approach\", ensuring policy consistency and preventing regulatory arbitrage. Continuing engagement with industry players is also crucial to foster a shared understanding of risks, our financial inclusion goals and market conduct expectations.\\nIn crafting commensurate regulations, the BSP has implemented key policy changes espousing the principle of \"proportionality. \" This approach promotes a level playing field and ensures that beneficial innovations are not hampered by unwarranted and excessive compliance requirements.\\nFor capacity build-up, the BSP continues to provide training and learning opportunities to fast-track the development process of our people to ensure that financial supervisors maintain the necessary knowledge, proficiency and competence to keep pace with the fast-evolving innovations.  We are also exploring regtech and suptech solutions, including the use of artificial intelligence, machine learning, cloud computing and APIs, to enhance the timeliness and quality of our risk-based decision-making.\\nAs part of BSP's fintech roadmap, I would like to share the BSP's test-and-learn approach or the regulatory sandbox as part of our supervisory toolkit in dealing with new and innovative technologies in the market. \\nThrough the so-called regulatory sandbox, pioneering solutions and technologies can be deployed in a live but controlled setting.\\nI will not go into each one of the steps but on a very high level, our \"test and learn\" approach has been proven to be useful in dealing with increasing digital innovations in the market and promoting development and innovation within the financial services industry.\\nIt provides an opportunity for innovators to connect to banks and other players with clear authority from the regulators. Such an approach helps the regulators assess potential risks and accordingly decide how to regulate the new market, if needed.\\nRecent examples of entities which approached BSP and devoted time and resources to conduct controlled and calculated experiments of their products include: (i) a pioneering rural bank that engaged a cloud service provider for its core banking system; (ii) a foreign bank which partnered with an electronic money issuer to offer its mobile based deposit product; (iii) a universal bank which explores potential use cases of a tokenized cash; and (iv) a universal bank which utilizes the blockchain platform to push its financial inclusion initiatives.\\nLet me quickly walk you through the five key steps in BSP's test and learn approach:\\nThe first step is to allow for market to develop and innovations to take place.\\nAfter engaging with fintech players, the BSP determines if the proposed innovation presents major regulatory concerns.  This is where the BSP checks the eligibility requirements such as soundness and feasibility of the business model, the proposed solution is innovative and not covered by existing regulations and the proponent demonstrates sound track record as well as resources/capability to successfully launch the pilot.\\nThe next step is to proceed with flexibility yet with caution.\\nDuring this phase, the BSP set certain limits/parameters or safeguards before fintech players fully market their products and services. We allow these pilot projects to run within clear parameters i.e. specific test time periods, localized markets or geography and limited users.  Likewise, risk management controls such as those covering cybersecurity risks, money laundering, consumer protection and other operational risks should be in place.\\nThe third step is to understand operating and business model.\\nAs the product or service is being offered in the market, the BSP can have better understanding of the operating/business models as well as technical considerations.\\nThe fourth step is for the BSP to adopt appropriate regulatory approach.\\nOnce the BSP fully understands the operating/business model as well as detailed mechanics of the innovative product/service, appropriate regulations are then issued. \\nLastly, the BSP closely monitors developments and related issues.\\nWe continue to monitor developments and introduce supervisory enhancements, when necessary, to address emerging issues and risks.\\nSimilar with the BSP's existing regulatory framework and supervisory approach covering banks and other financial institutions, the BSP also applies the same framework and approach that is commensurate to the FinTech's risk profile and systemic importance. \\nThis framework incorporates the following policy considerations:\\nFirst is Prudential Objective - In determining how BSP should supervise FinTechs, the safety and soundness of the individual institution, the stability of the financial system, the advancement of financial inclusion, and the undue regulatory burden are all taken into consideration.\\nSecond is the Landscape of the Financial System - In order to draw a holistic supervisory approach, BSP needs to have information on the financial ecosystem, particularly FinTechs. These include: the asset size, business condition like liquidity, profitability, capitalization, among others).\\nNext is the Risks Faced by FinTech - Considering their own business peculiarities, it is very important to also identify the risks specific to FinTech operations, these may include cybersecurity risk and AML risk, among others.\\nAnd lastly - Once we have identified these important information, we will now employ appropriate risk management standards based on the FinTech's business model, risk profile and degree of systemic importance.\\nThe ongoing challenge for the BSP is how to stay ahead of the curve when it comes to emerging financial technological innovations.\\nIn the same way technology is changing the financial industry, the BSP is also adopting innovations to enhance the way we regulate and supervise financial institutions. \\nThis is through the use of Regulatory Technology (RegTech) solutions aimed at enabling the BSP to have a more intensive, risk-focused and forward-looking supervision while easing BSFIs' regulatory compliance burdens.\\nWe are exploring regtech and suptech solutions, including the use of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and APIs, to enhance the timeliness and quality of our risk-based decision-making.\\nIn fact, we are now in the final stages of pilot implementation of two RegTech solutions. The first one is an automated complaint-handling system using a chatbot with the primary objective of improving the way customers lodged complaints against financial institutions.\\nThe second is an API system that automates the collection, processing and analysis of data from supervised institutions. Previously, banks were burdened by an extensive and time-consuming validation process, involving more than 240 Excel-based data entry templates with 100,000 plus data points. The resulting delays and the scope for human error posed complications on our data and statistical compilation operations. With this modern API system, manual intervention is eliminated since data sorting, sanitation and validation processes are fully automated and secured.  With the same 7,000 data validation rules still being applied, processing time of filed returns was cut from more than 30 minutes to just 10 seconds each, thereby streamlining the entire end-to-end process of regulatory reporting and validation.\\nOn the other hand, for the less sophisticated supervised entities that cannot immediately migrate to the API-based reporting, we developed a central automated reporting environment referred to as the FI Portal. The FI Portal provides a single electronic platform upon which FIs can submit reports, receive feedback on its acceptability, and exchange correspondences with the BSP on matters related to report submissions. It offers a more secure encrypted process of submission through a web facility where supervised entities can upload their reports instead of sending them via regular email.\\nWe are also undertaking major organizational reforms and initiatives for a more proactive supervisory stance. \\nWe have also recently set up a bigger, better and more agile Financial Technology Subsector to ensure the operational as well as cyber-resilience of the financial system. \\nThe new subsector in-charge of fostering responsible innovation in the financial services and payments industry is composed of two mission critical departments.  \\nOne is the Technology Risk and Innovation Supervision Department, which is primarily responsible for conducting onsite and offsite IT supervision of regulated entities.\\nIt is also in charge of cybersecurity surveillance and promoting digital or fintech innovation through the BSP's regulatory sandbox.\\nThe other department is the Payment Systems Oversight Department, which is mainly responsible for the payments oversight, licensing and policy development for a safe, efficient and reliable national payment system. PSOD is our lead in enforcing a holistic payment oversight framework, including the National Retail Payment System or the NRPS.\\nIn conclusion, the BSP adopts an open and flexible approach to financial innovation, given its crucial role in expanding our financial inclusion agenda. \\nWe are closely engaging with fintech stakeholders to gain a better understanding of their business models, processes and systems.\\nOur main challenge is to strike a balance between promoting and enabling a policy and regulatory environment for emerging financial innovations and ensuring consumer protection, security, and financial stability.\\nWe aim to establish a forward-looking approach to ensure that regulatory and supervisory frameworks are in tune with emerging trends and developments. \\nLadies and gentlemen, we are in an era where the biggest challenge is to keep up with the rapid pace of technological changes. To stay relevant is to remain proactive and vigilant in monitoring the advancements in technology and develop corresponding innovative solutions that intersects with traditional banking and other financial services and be agile.\\nWe need to take full advantage of and effectively harness fintech innovations that can be  to used to unlock financial inclusion barriers and facilitate digital financial transactions in ways never imagined before. \\nFinally, the BSP, as your partner in promoting financial innovation and inclusion, will remain committed in supporting beneficial fintech innovations through an enabling policy and regulatory environment.\\nI hope that as we all do our part in this, we keep the convenience, safety, and well-being of the Filipino people in mind.\\nThank you and I wish everyone a fruitful conference."

        "content": "Ladies and gentlemen,\\nToday is my first working day as the Chief Executive of the HKMA. Apart from the transition to a new position, I will also be faced with a challenging external and domestic environment.  This includes the weakening of global economic momentum, uncertainties over the China-US trade conflict and Brexit, unpredictable monetary policy stance across central banks especially in the US, and the social events in Hong Kong in recent months.  All these have presented huge challenges and uncertainties for the Hong Kong economy.\\nOur key priority in the next few years is to maintain Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability.\\nAnd, the foundation for this stability is the Linked Exchange Rate System (\"the Link\"), which has helped Hong Kong weather different financial storms since 1983. I've been involved in the operation of the Link throughout my career in the HKMA and I have also gone through two financial crises.  I firmly believe that the Link is the most appropriate monetary system for Hong Kong.  We see no need and have no intention of changing this well-established system.\\nOur banking system is also robust and sound. I'm confident that Hong Kong's financial system is well positioned to cope with market volatilities.\\nWe will also reinforce Hong Kong's role as a premier international financial centre. One key driver is the rapid development of Fintech.  While the HKMA has done a great deal in the past few years in promoting Fintech, there is still room to further apply new technology in finance in the coming years.  This includes, for example, fostering a better ecosystem for Regulatory Technology (or RegTech) and Supervisory Technology (or SupTech).  We are also aware that any new risks associated with the increasing use of technology have to be managed.  These include for example cyber and data security.  We will work with the industry to address these risks.\\nWe are also committed to promoting market development opportunities, especially in strengthening the role of Hong Kong as the gateway to the Mainland's capital markets, in the Greater Bay Area development, and also in green finance.\\nThese are rough times. But my colleagues and I will continue to discharge our duties in a professional manner and do our best to serve the people of Hong Kong."

        "content": "Thank you, Randy, for the kind introduction. It is a great pleasure to join you all this morning for the premiere of KUED's documentary Marriner Eccles: Father of the Modern Federal Reserve. It is also a great pleasure to be in Utah. It has been a long time since a Fed Chair made an official visit to Utah. Alan Greenspan spoke in Salt Lake City 22 years ago. All of the Utahns here know about the Eccles family's enormous contributions to building the economies of the state and the region. The documentary will remind us of Marriner's immense contribution not just to the region, but also to our nation during the Great Depression, World War II, and thereafter.\\nMany Eccles family members are present here today. I would like to especially recognize Marriner's grandson, Chip Eccles; Marriner's nephew, Spencer Eccles; and Spencer's daughter, Hope Eccles. Randy was fortunate to marry Hope, and he has a second Federal Reserve connection. He is our Vice Chair for Supervision.\\nIn a way, I feel that I know Marriner, too. I work in a building named after him. I sit in the office where he sat as Chair. And his portrait hangs in a room where I frequently meet with guests, Board colleagues, and staff. When I sit in my usual seat, he stands, looking over my left shoulder, an enigmatic expression-neither approving nor disapproving-on his face. Talk about pressure!\\nMore seriously, his legacy endures in much more than a name on a building and a portrait on a wall. As the Depression deepened, he presciently recognized that the federal government should act forcefully to put people back to work and stimulate business. In a speech delivered here in Utah in 1932, Marriner asked what was the purpose of an economic system if not to allow those willing and able to work the opportunity to do so, to \"guarantee to them sustenance for their families and protection against want and destitution.\"1 His ideas helped form the basis of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal and anticipated the not-yet-published tenets of British economist John Maynard Keynes. After World War II, he recognized, again presciently, that high inflation, not contraction, posed the principal threat to the U.S. economy.\\nAnd, perhaps most importantly from my perspective as Fed Chair, he is responsible more than any other person for the fact that the United States today has an independent central bank-a central bank able to make decisions in the long-term best interest of the economy, without regard to the political pressures of the moment. During his years on the Fed Board, Marriner played a crucial role in two landmark accomplishments that established the modern Federal Reserve-the Banking Act of 1935, near the start of his tenure at the Fed, and the Federal Reserve-Treasury Accord of 1951, at the end.\\nFDR nominated Marriner to lead the Fed Board in 1934. He accepted on the condition that Roosevelt support a restructuring of the Fed, which had failed to counter the contraction gripping the nation's economy. The result was the Banking Act of 1935, which significantly strengthened the structural independence of the Federal Reserve. And, symbolically important, it authorized the Board to move its meetings from the Treasury Department to a new building-the building that now bears Marriner's name-on Constitution Avenue, across from the Lincoln Memorial.\\nDuring World War II, the Fed effectively ceded control of monetary policy to the Treasury Department by agreeing to maintain a low interest rate peg on government bonds. The low rates helped the government finance the war, but after the war ended, inflation soared. It subsided for a time but, with the Korean War, spiked again. In 1951, Marriner led other Board members in precipitating a clean break with the peg arrangement, laying the foundation for the modern Fed. The Federal Reserve-Treasury Accord of that year separated government debt management from monetary policy and freed the Fed to combat high inflation and set short-term interest rates based on what was best for the economy.\\nThose are just the highlights of Marriner's Fed career. You will learn much more in the film we are about to see. In closing, I leave you with this statement from Marriner, inscribed on a plaque in the Eccles Building: \"The management of the central bank must be absolutely free from the dangers of control by politics and by private interests, singly or combined.\"1\\n1 See Marriner S. Eccles (1932), \"Depression: Its Causes, Effects and Suggested Remedies,\" speech delivered at the Utah State Bankers Convention, June 17, Marriner S.

        "content": "Dear Minister Denaj,\\nDear members of the National Payment System Committee,\\nDear ladies and gentlemen,\\nPlease allow me, at the outset, to express on behalf of the Bank of Albania our sincere appreciation for your continuous commitment and collaboration to achieving common objectives in the field of payments and beyond. The collaboration and discussion of development alternatives among the main market actors is considered as one of the main pillars for the success of the undertaken reforms. \\nIn this light, since 2015, the Bank of Albania has organised the National Payment System Committee (NPSC) to support and contribute to increasing the security, stability and efficiency of the national payment system in Albania. These objectives are rather important for the implementation of our monetary policy and for the financial and economic stability of Albania, by building up firm foundations for development and welfare. \\nI would like to highlight that the NPSC is set up based on best international and European Union practices. It is a strategic, consulting and communicating entity, whose decisions support the activities of the participating institutions in the area of payments. In this framework, it is worthy to note that during the five years of its existence, crucial results have been achieved, most noteworthy the approval of the National Retail Payments Strategy (2018-2023).\\nThe insofar findings clearly evidence the low financial inclusion of the Albanian population, not only compared with the European Union, but also with regional countries. All these are reflected in a high use of cash in the Albanian economy. Empirical studies by the Bank of Albania in collaboration with the World Bank Group show that the use of cash in economy, beyond the diminishing effects on the mechanisms of the Bank of Albania used for maintaining price stability and safeguarding financial stability, and supporting economic development, has a real cost from its use as a means of payment, amounting to more than 1% of GDP. Furthermore, the use of cash may be seen as a promoter of informality in economy. \\nHence, this strategy aims to establish a contemporary and comprehensive retail payments market, supported by safe and efficient infrastructures, as well as by a wide range of payments instruments and services that fulfil the needs of financially capable users across the country.\\nThis strategy, compiled with the valuable support of the World Bank Group, is the outcome of a long and analytical study and aims to best address the needs of the domestic market. \\nThe realisation of this vision is assessed to be materialised through a set of legal, regulatory and infrastructural developments, which promote technological developments and innovation in the payments market. \\nIn this regard, I would like to point out that the inclusion of information technology developments in financial services is increasingly drawing the attention of central banks, regulatory and supervisory authorities worldwide. Both international and domestic practices show that a comprehensive approach through collaboration considerably supports the achievement of effective and optimal results. \\nA concrete example of aligned efforts in this regard is exactly the one in the field of payments. In this field, the measures undertaken by the Government of Albania for the digitalisation of government services and recently for the draft-law \"on billing and monitoring system of circulation\", which aims at increasing and strengthening the fiscalisation of the Albanian economy, appear to fully harmonise with the initiatives undertaken by the Bank of Albania, through the National Payment System Committee, for modernising the payment market and increasing financial inclusion. \\nThe Bank of Albania has worked on drafting a new legal and regulatory framework, which aims at promoting digitalisation in the area of payment services. The compilation of the draft-law \"On payment services\" is considered as the first and crucial step in the framework of reforming and digitalising the small-value payments.\\nIn concrete terms, this draft-law is seen to considerably encourage the competition in the market, by providing a crucial contribution to the establishment of low cost services and easily accessible by the large public. \\nDear ladies and gentlemen,\\nThe promotion of the above objectives is not only important for the functions of the Bank of Albania as the monetary authority, but it also provides an essential contribution to the economic development and welfare of the general public. \\nAll these developments would provide the expected effects only if they are based on measures in the framework of financial education of the public. Being aware that financial literacy constitutes a significant instrument for promoting the development of the market, for more than a decade, the central bank has been engaged in designing and developing educational programmes to address the needs of groups of interest.\\nIt is not a coincidence that the focus of central bank, in both, advanced and developing countries, is on enhancing financial literacy.  Numerous studies have shown that financial education has multiple benefits.  Being familiar with the basic financial and economic concepts, appropriately knowing and using banking products and financial instruments as well as the ability to manage personal and household finances, are crucial to achieve individual, and societal welfare.\\nOn the other hand, a well-informed financial decision of households helps central banks to accomplish their mandate in achieving price stability and safeguarding financial stability. A better understanding of monetary policy accelerates its effective transmission to the real economy.  Meanwhile, the quality of decisions for financing or investment has a direct impact on the stability of the whole financial system.\\nThe Bank of Albania has been intensively involved in financial education over the years and this long-standing experience has clearly identified the need for a coordinated initiative at national level up to the upgrading this objective to a reform level of crucial importance for the country. \\nFor this purpose, the Bank of Albania, driven by the requirements of other authorities, and of market stakeholders, considered as indispensable the drafting of a National Strategy for Financial Education that you are also going to address in this meeting and the real outcomes in this regard are expected to become materialised very soon. \\nWe are confident that such a strategic document - tailored for the local financial education context - would help through joint and coordinated actions and resources of various stakeholders in increasing effectiveness of objectives for cultivating a financial literacy in the Albanian society.  I invite, therefore, all the participating institutions to engage and contribute actively to this initiative. \\nConcluding, I sincerely hope that this NPSC meeting will actively discuss and deliberate on various issues that need to be addressed about relevant topics.\\nThank you for your attention!"

        "title": "Randal K Quarles: The Financial Stability Board at 10 years - looking back and looking ahead",
        "content": "Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today. The European Banking Federation is often referred to as the voice of Europe's banks, and I am here in the hopes that you are the ears of those institutions as well.\\nThis year, 2019, is the 10th anniversary of the founding of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), which means it has also been 10 years since some of the darker days of the global financial crisis. The FSB was not born on a sunny day; it was born of necessity, with storm clouds still looming.\\nAn anniversary-particularly a 10th anniversary-is a good opportunity for reflection. Not far from here, in Antwerp, the artist Peter Paul Rubens painted the \"Temple of Janus.\" Janus was a Roman god who could look both backward and forward in time, and when Rubens painted the work, citizens of Antwerp were at a turning point and were wondering what the future held for them. Today, I would like to take on the role of Janus. I would like to look back on the experiences of the past 10 years, what the FSB has accomplished, and also offer some perspective on just how it contributed to the construction of the post-crisis global financial architecture. As you would expect, I believe the FSB has and will continue to play an important role in our global financial system. I will discuss why that is. I would then like to look ahead to the new challenges facing the global regulatory community, such as innovations in financial technology, shifts in financial globalization and integration, and increasing nonbank financial intermediation.\\nTen years ago, after the events of the fall of 2008, the G20 nations recognized that the response to the crisis had to be urgent, it had to be credible, and it had to be global. The regulatory community knew it must work to regain the confidence of financial institutions, market participants, and the broader public. They knew that then-existing arrangements for international cooperation were not up to that task.\\nThe Financial Stability Forum (FSF), the predecessor of the FSB, had been founded by the G7 countries in 1999 after a series of financial crises in the latter part of the 1990s. The group was intended to enhance cooperation among various national and international supervisory bodies and multilateral financial institutions in order to promote stability in the international financial system. Membership was relatively narrow, with only 12 countries and few emerging markets represented.\\nWhile the group discussed matters related to financial stability, the areas it was asked to study were relatively narrow, and combined with its limited membership, it had relatively little scope to promote regulatory reform. The looseness of this arrangement represented the prevailing view in advanced nations at the time that national regulators and finance ministries were capable of monitoring and dealing with risks to global financial stability. On the one hand, these nations had long recognized that effective capital regulation of banks with a global footprint was only possible with coordination on minimal capital standards-the Basel Committee process. But there was no such consensus about financial stability, perhaps rooted in a belief, rarely expressed but widespread, that a severe global financial crisis was highly unlikely, and that traditional prudential supervision would be enough to prevent it. Major banks in Europe, Japan, and the United States had been affected by debt crises in developing countries in the 1980s and 1990s, but these crises had never seriously threatened advanced economies.\\nIn the fall of 2008, G20 leaders recognized that the severity of the emerging global financial crisis required a response that was beyond the capabilities of the FSF. Like that Long Island police chief in the movie \"Jaws,\" ministers and leaders saw what was racing toward them and decided that they were going to need a bigger boat. Specifically, they recognized there was a major deficiency in the FSF that prevented it from being very effective in establishing international financial regulatory standards. The FSF was narrow-geographically, in the number of governments, and substantively, in the range of ministries, central banks, and important regulatory agencies that were not members. Some of the world's largest economies and financial markets were not represented, in particular emerging markets like China, India, Brazil, Mexico, and South Africa. As of 2009, only 58 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP) was represented, compared to 83 percent of GDP under the FSB today. The issue of representation was crucial, because the financial crisis required a fully global response.\\nAs a result, in April of 2009 at the G20 summit in London, the heads of state and government called for an organization \"with a stronger institutional basis and enhanced capacity\" that would allow them to achieve \"much greater consistency and systematic cooperation between countries-that a global financial system requires.\" Behind those simple words was a sea change in the willingness of advanced nations to tackle significant coordination on financial regulation. The crisis that had been raging at that point for over a year made the need for such a commitment inescapable.\\nWith the creation of the FSB, the G20 designed a new regulatory organization with global reach dedicated to advancing and coordinating a newly embraced priority for the global economy-far-reaching reform of financial regulation and supervision. The FSB membership spans central banks, ministries of finance, supervisors of financial institutions, international financial organizations, and market regulators. It has a broad mandate centered on financial stability and coordination of responses for those most challenging issues that cut across the traditional mandates of other global standard-setting bodies. In addition, one of the FSB's chief responsibilities is scanning the horizon for financial vulnerabilities, making it an inherently forward-looking body.\\nThe exigency of the crisis helped overcome longstanding deficiencies in the structure of the FSF, rooted in differences between the members or ambivalence about international standard setting itself, related to financial stability. The crisis helped bridge differences and reach consensus, so that quick initial progress was made on matters that required urgent action. In addition to those actions, the members also recognized that work must begin immediately to develop new regulatory standards for capital and liquidity, derivatives reform, and issues stemming from the nonbanking sector which would require some time for data gathering and extensive public consultation. Creation of the FSB was one of a number of steps taken at the international level in the spring of 2009 that over the subsequent months helped restore confidence in the banking system and begin the process of recovery.\\nSince the FSB was born with the global economy and financial markets still in turmoil, immediate attention was needed in a number of core areas: over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, prudential bank standards, resolution, and nonbank finance. Much of the FSB's first 10 years has been focused on these issues, and a great deal has been accomplished, resulting in a significantly strengthened and more resilient global financial system. So let me quickly review our work in these areas.\\nOver-the-Counter Derivatives\\nThe elements of the FSB's agenda for OTC derivatives fall into four categories: 1) central clearing of standardized OTC derivatives, where appropriate, 2) exchange or electronic platform trading of standardized OTC derivatives, 3) reporting to trade repositories, and 4) higher capital and margin requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives. The most recent report on implementation progress finds that in the jurisdictions with the largest OTC derivatives markets, there is almost complete implementation of the necessary reforms. That means that today, OTC derivatives markets, which are crucial for the functioning of our financial system, are simpler, more transparent, and generally more resilient.\\nPrudential Bank Standards\\nThe FSB has endorsed the work of the Basel Committee that is aimed at enhanced prudential standards for internationally active banking organizations, a process known as Basel III. The main elements of Basel III are: a stronger risk-based capital adequacy framework; a leverage ratio requirement; a capital surcharge for global systemically important banks; a liquidity coverage ratio liquidity requirement; a net stable funding ratio liquidity requirement; and a large exposures framework.\\nAll 24 member jurisdictions of the FSB have the core elements of Basel III risk-based capital and liquidity measures in place. However, there has been uneven progress on some of the other elements. Some jurisdictions have not yet fully implemented the large exposures framework, the leverage ratio, and the net stable funding ratio. And most jurisdictions are just starting to implement the Basel III \"end game\" reforms agreed in December 2017. We have some work left to do but I am confident that it will be completed, and the FSB will continue to push all of its members for full completion of these important measures.\\nResolution\\nOne of the most important issues the world faced during the financial crisis was the \"too-big-to-fail\" dilemma. The large and unpopular bailouts that were deployed to help stem the crisis made it clear that an alternative was needed to deal with \"too big to fail.\"\\nIn response, the FSB established the \"Key Attributes for Effective Resolution,\" which identify the responsibilities, instruments, and powers that national resolution regimes should follow if they have to resolve a failing systemically important financial institution or SIFI. The FSB's resolution work also included a new total loss absorbing capacity requirement to help ensure that authorities are able to conduct a bail-in recapitalization of a failed SIFI. Too big to fail was a defining issue of the crisis, and recognizing the importance of the work that has been done to end it, this year the FSB kicked off an evaluation of the effects of the reforms that have been put in place around the world to deal with the issue. By next year, I hope we will be able to discuss the results of that work.\\nNonbank Financial Intermediation\\nDuring the crisis, \"shadow banking\" became the term for any type of financial activity that occurred outside banks that resembled what banks did and that often wasn't completely understood. Within the FSB, we refer to those activities as nonbank financial intermediation, or NBFI. Regardless of its name, a lot of blame for the problems that arose in the global financial crisis centered on risks that emerged from some activities in parts of this sector, and one of the FSB's first jobs was to try to look into these activities to better understand their growing role in financial markets.\\nAmong the important steps we took was a global monitoring exercise that results in an annual report on the size of NBFI in the global economy. That work actually goes beyond the membership of the FSB, since a number of important international financial centers also report information to us. With all of that information, we are able to track the overall size of nonbank financial intermediation, which in 2017 grew to $184 trillion, representing nearly half of financial activity in 21 countries plus the euro area. More important, we are now able to more carefully categorize activities in the nonbank sector in order to analyze potential vulnerabilities.\\nIn addition to monitoring, we have made a number of other recommendations and are working with fellow global standard setters to implement them. For example, we are working with the International Association of Insurance Supervisors on capital standards for global insurers, and we are working with the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) on liquidity and leverage in the funds industry. The funds sector continues to evolve, so we will focus particular attention here as we move forward.\\nStatus of Post-Crisis Reform\\nThe result of 10 years of policy development by the FSB and implementation at the national level has been a stronger, more resilient global financial system. Large banks are better capitalized, less levered, and more liquid. Too-big-to-fail reforms are well-advanced, particularly with the formation of effective resolution regimes for banks. OTC derivatives markets are simpler and more transparent. Nonbank financial intermediation risks are better understood, and steps are being taken to reduce and contain them. While shocks to the system, especially from unanticipated directions, can never be ruled out, these reforms go a long way to reducing the likelihood and severity of future crises.\\nConsequently, the FSB has started to pivot from policy development to evaluating the effectiveness of the reforms it has advocated. I just mentioned that this year the FSB began a two-year evaluation of its too-big-to-fail reform package. We are also completing an evaluation of the effects that reforms have had on infrastructure finance and lending to small- and medium-sized enterprises. Going forward, these evaluations will be critical for assessing where more work needs to be done.\\nCasting my gaze backward, there is much to be proud of in the last decade, success that is reflected in the strength and stability of the global financial system. So now I would like to leave the past behind and turn to the future. But while Janus was the god of beginnings, he was also the god of endings, and as such was able to look both backwards and forwards at the same time.\\nAssessing financial vulnerabilities is a critical part of the FSB mandate, and that is inherently a forward-looking job. The global financial system is constantly evolving, influenced in part by past experience, and by regulation. As I look ahead, I think we must consider whether the ways in which we responded to the financial crisis may not be the most appropriate ones to address the challenges and ongoing changes in the financial system that we currently face.\\nThis year the FSB has embarked on an important project to review and update its financial stability surveillance framework. While much of the attention of the FSB in its early years was on post-crisis reforms, members also spent time thinking about new vulnerabilities to the system. As we reach our 10th anniversary, it is a good time to review the ways we monitor the ever-changing financial system. The aim of this review is to ensure that we have a framework that is comprehensive, consistent over time, and effective at identifying relevant vulnerabilities. If we are not at the cutting edge in our ability to assess the state of the financial system, we do a disservice to the public we serve, which relies on a smoothly functioning financial system. In addition, we are looking at how we communicate our understanding of the state of the financial system to the G20 and to the world. We want to be more open about our assessment, but great care has to be taken to avoid a situation where revelations about emerging concerns lead to acceleration of those concerns and becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.\\nAs I look forward and ponder the forces that are shaping the evolution of the global financial system, the FSB is currently grappling with two issues-financial innovation and market fragmentation-that have the potential to profoundly affect financial stability, so let me start there.\\nOwing to our forward-looking orientation, the FSB has been actively engaged in monitoring financial innovation for some time. Starting a little over five years ago, there was an explosion of financial innovation that had a technological component, which we now call fintech. This encompasses peer-to-peer lending, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, and the use of new techniques like artificial intelligence and machine learning. In 2017, the FSB issued a report on the implications of fintech for financial stability. The report was careful to note the potential benefits of many of these innovations, including the possibility of greater financial inclusion and increased speed of financial transactions. However, the report also drew attention to several supervisory and regulatory issues, including three priorities where international collaboration is critical: managing operational risk from third-party service providers, mitigating cyber risks, and monitoring macrofinancial risks that could emerge as fintech activities increase.1\\nMore recently, one particular area of fintech has received a lot of attention-stablecoins. These are a type of crypto-asset that attempts to address the volatility of some crypto-assets by tying their value to conventional assets, such as the value of the U.S. dollar or a basket of currencies. While it hasn't been created yet, it is Facebook's proposal for a new stablecoin that significantly increased the public's attention to stablecoins. At the FSB, we undertake regular monitoring of the financial stability implications of crypto-assets, and we have had discussions about the regulatory and supervisory approaches to crypto-assets and potential gaps in regulation. The introduction of stablecoins, however, brings a potentially new scale and scope that the financial regulatory community must carefully consider. Although there is a small risk to financial stability today, there is no doubt the potential scale of stablecoins and other crypto-assets yet to emerge may pose regulatory challenges. At present, the G7 is finishing a preliminary assessment of stablecoins, and the G20 has asked the FSB to lead the work going forward, which we are actively undertaking. This is an issue that can potentially affect every country in the world. We have already begun work to identify which regulations exist that apply to stablecoins in our jurisdictions, and once that assessment is complete, we will report to the G20 on any appropriate actions that need to be taken to ensure that financial stability is not negatively affected by their introduction.\\nThe FSB is grappling with other challenges beyond fintech. As time has passed since the financial crisis, there is concern about fragmentation of financial markets-a sense that globalization of financial markets may be slowing and differences in the regulatory requirements at the national level may be on the rise. Some forms of market fragmentation may have financial stability benefits, such as reasonable loss absorbency requirements imposed on subsidiaries of global banks, but market fragmentation may also bring about unintended negative consequences, such as increased opportunities for regulatory arbitrage and cumulatively higher regulatory burdens for firms.\\nOver the past year, at the request of the G20, the FSB has been examining the different forms in which market fragmentation is manifest. Following up on that, we recently held a workshop where FSB members met with representatives from the private sector and from academia to discuss the internal allocation of capital and liquidity by global financial institutions.2 We are also following up in other areas, such as working with IOSCO on issues related to deference and examining improved ways for regulatory and supervisory information sharing. Market fragmentation is an issue that will never disappear, and we will remain vigilant to ensure that it does not pose a threat to financial stability.\\nAt the outset today, I said I was going to take the mantle of Janus, who could look backward and forward in time. Janus was also the god of transitions, which makes him doubly appropriate for the FSB at this time, because we find ourselves in transition from a time when we were largely focused on addressing the effects and the lessons of the financial crisis. We now find ourselves with increasingly focused energy on looking forward, with both a strong organization that has been tested through an intense period of policy formulation and implementation and a strong global financial system resulting from those efforts. I hope that 10 years from now, a successor of mine as FSB Chair can point to 10 more years of success in flexibly and adeptly responding to all that the global financial system throws at us. Speaking on behalf of the members of the FSB, we stand ready.\\n1 Consumer protection is a major concern in relation to fintech and cyber risk, but it is outside the FSB's mandate and is being handled by member governments.\\n2 Randal K.

        "title": "Luis de Guindos: Improving macroeconomic stabilisation in the euro area",
        "content": "Introduction\\nA decade after the global financial crisis, the level of economic activity in the euro area remains disappointingly low. It took nine years for real per capita GDP to surpass its 2007 level. Likewise, euro area inflation has stubbornly remained below the ECB's aim for much of the past decade.\\nThroughout this period, the ECB has acted decisively to support euro area demand and raise inflation onto a sustainable path towards our aim of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. This has included lowering the key ECB rates to record low levels and adopting a wide range of non-standard monetary policy measures.\\nBy contrast, the contribution from fiscal policy to macroeconomic stabilisation in the post-crisis period has been muted at best. From 2010 to 2012, economies representing around one-third of euro area GDP carried out procyclical fiscal tightening to restore confidence in their public debt, which significantly contributed to the second recession in that period. Since then, fiscal policy has been broadly neutral.\\nAt our last meeting, the Governing Council responded to the continued shortfall of inflation with respect to our aim. Recent economic data point to a more protracted weakness in the euro area economy. Prominent downside risks remain and inflationary pressures are muted. We introduced a package of measures designed to support the euro area expansion, the ongoing build-up of domestic price pressures and, thus, the sustained convergence of inflation to our medium-term aim.\\nWe also noted the need for countries with fiscal space to act in a timely and effective manner and for all countries to reinforce their efforts to achieve a more growth-friendly composition of public finances.\\nIn my remarks today, I will focus on the roles of monetary and fiscal policy in supporting macroeconomic stabilisation in the euro area. In particular, I will explain why now is a particularly appropriate time for fiscal stimulus. I will also offer some thoughts on how to improve the current fiscal framework.\\nMacroeconomic stabilisation in a monetary union\\nThe literature on optimal currency areas points to the need to counter two types of shocks: those that are common to all countries, and asymmetric ones that affect a subset of countries.\\nFor common shocks, monetary policy can act to stabilise the economy.\\nBut for idiosyncratic shocks, stabilisation becomes trickier. Monetary policy cannot target individual countries, and those affected can no longer adjust their exchange rate to help cushion the effects of the shock. Hence the literature emphasises the need for economic cycles to converge, so that common shocks generally dominate. For asymmetric shocks, stabilisation comes ex ante from greater cross-border risk-sharing to improve resilience, and ex post from fiscal policy.\\nBut in the light of recent experience, it is worth revisiting this classic separation between using monetary policy for common shocks and fiscal policy for asymmetric shocks. Fiscal policy at a national level in the euro area was unable to fully counter asymmetric shocks during the crisis. And at an aggregate level, stabilisation may benefit from monetary and fiscal policy working in tandem given the current environment of low interest rates.\\nNominal interest rates have been declining in advanced economies since the 1980s. In large part, this decline is attributable to the decline in average inflation over that period. Investors require lower compensation for expected future inflation, and the fall in inflation volatility has also reduced the inflation risk premium. The decline is also a result of a secular fall in the natural rate of interest, which is the rate that balances desired saving and investment in the economy. While the natural rate cannot be precisely measured, a range of estimates point to its decline.\\nThere are a number of contributing factors to this decline, principal among which is lower potential growth. Lower potential growth reduces the expected rate of return on capital, so reduces the rate at which firms are prepared to borrow to invest.\\nOther factors that are believed to have further weighed on the natural rate of interest include the ageing population in Europe, the role of income distribution, increased saving in emerging markets and a general rise in risk aversion.\\nThis fall in the natural rate of interest has important implications for the optimal policy mix in the euro area. The interest rate at which monetary policy becomes accommodative falls directly in line with the natural rate, so the effective lower bound on nominal rates has become a much greater consideration when setting policy. Before the crisis, it was estimated that interest rates in the euro area would be likely to hit zero only once every 50 years.1 At the current natural rate, rates of zero or below are likely to be a much more frequent occurrence.\\nAs the experience of the past decade has shown, the decline of the natural rate is not an impediment to monetary policy providing accommodation to the economy. But it does mean that monetary policy has to remain accommodative for longer and make greater use of unconventional measures. Those factors carry with them an increased risk of undesired side effects.\\nIn such a situation, economic theory tells us that fiscal policy should play a much more substantive role in business cycle stabilisation than it usually would.2 The reason for this is straightforward.\\nIn normal times, when output is close to potential and inflation is close to its objective, a fiscal expansion threatens to push inflation above the central bank's aim. Central banks respond by raising their policy rates, and the increase in interest rates partially crowds out private sector demand. However, when the economy operates below potential the central bank has no reason to fight a fiscal expansion. Policy rates would not increase and private sector demand would be crowded in, leading to a much larger positive effect on aggregate demand and inflation.\\nIn other words, when policy rates are close to the lower bound, fiscal policy becomes more effective in stimulating aggregate demand.3\\nMoreover, while monetary policy must take the natural rate of interest as given, fiscal policy - if enacted appropriately - can help raise it, in turn making monetary policy more powerful. Policies to encourage more people, especially older workers, to participate in the labour force can help raise rates. Increasing spending on education and public investment can support productivity and lift both potential growth and private investment.4\\nEvery policy implies trade-offs, of course. The side effects of very accommodative monetary policy may become unduly tangible when the economy operates below potential for a long time. In fact, while we believe that, overall, the benefits outweigh the costs, we acknowledge the challenges that a sustained low interest rate environment poses for banks.\\nReforming the fiscal framework\\nSo there is a role for fiscal policy to play in helping to counter common shocks at the European level. To the extent that Member States have created fiscal space, it would therefore be desirable for fiscal policy in the euro area to support business cycle stabilisation more actively. Our current assessment is that the fiscal stance is only mildly expansionary at the aggregate level.\\nBut the current institutional framework is insufficient to deliver that required stimulus.\\nFiscal policy remains a national responsibility in Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), with some common rules applicable to individual countries. In its first incarnation, the Stability and Growth Pact focused almost exclusively on fiscal sustainability, with little emphasis on fiscal stabilisation.5 In recent years it has undergone several reforms, some of them with the explicit aim of providing greater prominence to stabilisation considerations, both at the country level and at the euro area level. The result has been rules which are now viewed as complex and opaque, with little evidence that they have delivered a more countercyclical fiscal policy stance in the euro area.6\\nThe Stability and Growth Pact has limited flexibility and does not lend itself to incorporating area-wide stabilisation elements. National fiscal rules, with a focus on domestic issues, tend to neglect positive cross-border spillovers. They fail to recognise the benefits of cross-country risk-sharing and the vital role played by the public sector in underpinning it.\\nIn other words, rules based purely at a national level, or even rules that coordinate a fiscal stance across countries, are not enough by themselves. Empirical evidence suggests that spillovers from a fiscal expansion in one euro area country to others are positive, but small. So while it is important for those countries with available fiscal space to use it domestically to support overall stabilisation, a central fiscal capacity with the ability to allocate expenditure across countries would be more powerful.\\nA dedicated centralised fiscal capacity would not interfere with domestic policy. By focusing on common area-wide stabilisation it need not affect national fiscal space but rather provide an additional layer. This focus would also help ensure that areas of expenditure that are vital for long-run growth are not cut during a downturn, helping to preserve future fiscal space and support real interest rates over the long term.\\nA central fiscal capacity of this sort would clearly need to be carefully designed to mitigate any risk of moral hazard. But, crucially, it should have sufficient firepower to effectively contribute to macroeconomic stabilisation. It needs to be sizeable and agile enough to react rapidly to emerging threats.\\nBut macroeconomic stabilisation in the euro area can only function properly when other EMU features and institutions are adequately designed and operational.\\nFirst, the banking union needs to be completed. Unified banking supervision and the Single Resolution Fund (SRF) have provided greater confidence that banks operating in other euro area countries face the same conditions as in their home market. But the banking union will remain incomplete until a common deposit insurance scheme has been introduced and the fiscal backstop for the SRF has increased in size. While there is political agreement about the SRF backstop and its terms of reference, there is not yet agreement on the European deposit insurance scheme.\\nSecond, it is imperative to accelerate progress on the capital markets union. This is ambitious. It entails streamlining core aspects of national policies, such as taxation and insolvency regimes, which are essential for integrating the legal underpinnings of cross-border markets. Capital markets can smooth country-specific shocks by providing a larger pool of financial assets that can be shared across borders. This helps to decouple wealth and income - and hence consumption - from output.\\nConclusion\\nLet me conclude.\\nThe euro area risk outlook is again tilted to the downside. This is a conjunctural concern. The global decline in the natural rate of interest over the past quarter of a century, however, poses structural challenges. Policy rates will likely remain low, by historical standards, and may hit their lower bounds more frequently than in the past.7 We have learned from the experience in Japan that it is possible to get caught in a vicious cycle of declining inflation expectations, falling inflation and a binding lower bound on nominal interest rates from which it is difficult to escape.\\nIt is thus of utmost importance that we enhance the firepower of euro area stabilisation policy by means of a policy mix that, while continuing to make full use of monetary policy, assigns a more substantive role to fiscal stabilisation policy. Laying the institutional foundations for a European fiscal capacity would be an important step in this direction.\\n1 See Coenen, G.

        "title": "Yaron Amir: Bank of Israel's recommendations for increasing the standard of living while maintaining fiscal discipline",
        "content": "Good morning.\\nI greatly appreciate the opportunity to speak here today. This is a very important time, with the election campaign drawing to a close, while millions of children are returning to school to further their education and obtain the tools necessary to lead the country into the future.  I would therefore like to take the opportunity to discussion issues that involve each one of us as individuals, and all of us, particularly the Bank of Israel, at the societal level: the future of our children and further generations, and the standard of living that we want to improve for their benefit, and also of course for our benefit as a country.\\nA few days ago, the Bank of Israel Research Department published a document that dealt entirely with the measures necessary to increase the standard of living in Israel.  At the Bank of Israel, we asked ourselves how to do this, and the answer is that the focus must be on improving worker productivity in Israel.  This is the \"roadmap\" that we created.  These recommendations illustrate the Bank of Israel's commitment to deal with the most pressing macroeconomic issues for the economy as part of my job as economic advisor to the government, and based on a professional in-depth analysis.  I will expand on this in a few moments.\\nBut before that, I would like to briefly discuss the vision that I and the Bank have in dealing with, and guiding policymakers in dealing with, the issue even now.  The informed decisions made by policymakers in our country from its founding until today established and strengthened the Israeli economy, its stability, and its power, and led us to a situation in which we are now ready to begin taking the necessary steps to prepare the economy for the coming decades.  Israel must, and can, implement these recommendations.  Implementing the Bank of Israel's recommendations will help take Israel into the future with a higher standard of living.  I say this with complete certainty.\\nThis obviously requires considerable investment.  The cost of the measures that appear in the report, when fully implemented a few years from now, is not low-close to 3 percent of GDP, which is about NIS 44 billion per year in current GDP terms.  The cost is high due to the large gaps that have developed in various areas over recent decades.  However, the investment will be very well worth it.  Our assessment of the additional GDP in the long-term from implementing the recommendations is much higher-about 20 percent of GDP per year.  Or, to put it more simply, about NIS 270 billion shekels more, in current GDP terms, for our children and future generations.\\nI emphasize that the implementation of this program will not come at the expense of the need to deal decisively with fiscal issues and the growing deficit.  I have previously enumerated the measures that the government and the Knesset will have to take in order to deal with the fiscal necessities: reducing inefficient expenditures to start, cancelling tax exemptions, and apparently also raising tax rates.  This does not contradict the need or the possibilities of starting to implement the recommendations right now.  First and foremost, the stage of planning and building the tools to implement the reforms, which is an essential part of adopting the recommendations, will take time, and its cost is relatively negligible. In addition, there are many recommendations that can be implemented even today, since they deal with diverting existing sources, and with administrative processes.\\nI will now briefly discuss the main points of the recommendations and the background of the report.  Output per work hour in Israel, what we economists define as \"labor productivity\", is 24 percent lower than the OECD average, and this gap has not declined in recent decades.  This gap has large implications for the standard of living in Israel.  The low level of productivity compared with other advanced economies is reflected in lower wages and standard of living in Israel than in other western countries. We found that the labor productivity gap to Israel's disadvantage is mainly due to a number of factors: the relatively low quality of education and teaching in Israel; the lag in the level of infrastructure and the quantity of business capital; and public sector regulations and bureaucracy.\\nIn the field of education: In recent years, there is a greater recognition that despite the fact that Israel is the Startup Nation that gave us the flash drive, WAZE, Mobileye, and a wealth of complex cyber solutions, most Israeli workers lack the ability to solve more basic problems.  In addition to our marked lag in average skills, Israel also feature a high level of inequality in scholastic achievements, with large differences in basic labor skills among workers, large wage gaps, and large differences in productivity levels between the various industries. While the strong workers in Israel are similar in output and skills to the strong workers in other countries, the weaker workers in Israel are far weaker than their peers abroad.\\nSo how can we strengthen the \"weaker\" workers and raise the output per worker in Israel?\\nThere is a direct-and causal-connection between a labor force's quality of education and productivity, with an emphasis on the importance of basic cognitive skills that enable a change in profession during one's lifetime. Eric Hanushek of Stanford University shows this in a series of studies he conducted in recent years.\\nIt is important to state that the gaps in the quality of education in Israel exist in almost all age groups and education groups, and are not the purview of a certain segment of Israeli society.  Therefore, the treatment of the problem must encompass all levels of education, and begin in preschool.  In his research, Nobel prize winner James Heckman found how important the preschool starting point is for economic success during life, particularly for children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.  It is therefore important that daycare centers for children from weaker backgrounds begin the educational process at very young ages.  At the same time, it is important that subsidies for the cost of daycare for weaker population groups be adjusted to increase the incentives to work for both parents.  Such steps lead to a double benefit.  They can materially contribute to future growth, and can contribute to reducing gaps and increase equality of opportunity.\\nAs economists, we avoid dealing with pedagogical issues. We focus on incentives that will help improvement in an area, and recommend adjusting the payment structure for teachers to the urgent needs of the system: improvement payment for those with training in subjects where there is a lag in achievements and a lack of teachers (mathematics, sciences, and English), and improving salaries for teachers to teach in schools that cater to students with weaker backgrounds.  This is all on condition that there are continuous evaluations of the success of the teachers and of the schools in creating scholastic, educational, and social improvements.\\nIn addition to the investment required at young ages, there are also measures that are necessary for the older population.  In Israel, too little is invested in developing human capital at older ages through professional training programs. The increasing flexibility of the labor market, and the extension of a person's working life as life expectancy and the effective retirement age increase require significant reforms in this area, both in improving the output of technological colleges, and in adapting the content of the courses. The reform that the government recently adopted in the technological colleges is an important step in the right direction, and the recommendations that appear in this field in the draft report of the 2030 Committee appointed by the government point to additional important measures that will help Israel to better deal with the issue of professional training.\\nIn the field of business capital: The high level of variance in the Israeli economy is also reflected in the extent of innovation and the volume of investment in physical capital in different industries.  In this area, the situation is good in exporting industries, particularly in software industries, but it requires improvement in the rest of the economy, compared to parallel areas in other countries.  Why is this happening?  First, it is reasonable to assume that some of it is a natural result of market forces.  Israel developed a relative advantage in the field of high-tech, which makes successful investments and attracts select software and hardware people.  However, the government's involvement encourages these successful areas of activity directly and almost exclusively, thereby raising the costs of human and physical means of production for the other industries, which employ most of the workers in the economy.  Over time, the productivity of export companies will have difficulty continuing to grow, as companies that provide them with raw materials and services remain so far behind.\\nTherefore, a gradual change is required that will make support of the principle industries based on incentivizing the various areas of activity and industries by economic criteria that will lead the economy to higher returns on investment and government support-among exports, which can continue to benefit from it, and among domestic manufacturers.  It is important to focus on running programs that support the removal of market failures that delay production and the implementation of unique knowledge, innovation, and management methods that can spill over to other companies.  Such a policy, alongside the effect of streamlining and the reduction of regulation, which I will discuss later, may contribute significantly to increased stock of capital in exporting industries and in domestic industries as one.\\nIn the field of infrastructure: The rate of investment in transport infrastructure in Israel has been similar in recent years to the average rate of investment in OECD countries, but is far from what is necessary to reduce the gap in transit efficiency compared with the leading countries.  This is due both to the accumulated gap and to the rapid population increase in Israel.  Improving the transport system, particularly public transit, will shorten the time wasted in traffic.  An example that I heard, and which illustrates the issue well is that a plumber in Gush Dan manages to get to half the amount of homes that a plumber who works in areas without large traffic jams can service.  This is a situation that, obviously, creates lower output for that plumber, and raises the cost of his service to the consumer.\\nRegulation and the business environment: Israel is ranked 29th out of the 34 OECD countries in terms of the regulatory ease of doing business.  Despite the government's recognition of the importance of the issue, actual improvement is confused and very slow.  It is therefore important to accelerate the process of adopting regulations from other advanced economies, unless there are significant reasons to avoid this in individual cases.  This will help to both ease the regulatory burden and to increase international competition in the economy.  In addition, in order to streamline bureaucratic processes, we suggest setting targets in public sector wage agreements for the adoption of digital processes in government services to the business sector.\\nThe current fiscal situation is weighing down on the ability to finance the required investment. The government's structural deficit has increased in recent years to more than 3.5 percent of GDP, and without a significant correction, it is expected to continue growing in 2021 and onward.  The implementation of this program will not come at the expense of the need to deal with fiscal issues and the growing deficit.  On the contrary: the required investments make it necessary to rapidly and decisively deal with the existing deficit.\\nSince the large expenses due to the programs presented are expected only in a few years' time, after the initial steps have been implemented and the plans for advancing infrastructure are fully prepared, it is important that the government prepare for early implementation in terms of the fiscal frameworks that will allow those investments that have the capability of significantly improving the standard of living in Israel.  Such preparation is important, first and foremost to ensure the continued stability of the economy, but also to ensure greater ability of sources for financing the required investments.  This means the early convergence of the deficit, which will ensure at least the stabilization of the public debt to GDP ratio, and maintaining this level in the coming years alongside the gradual implementation of the growth-supporting measures proposed in this program.\\nI would like to emphasize that we do not intend to recommend financing the investments-even though their expected return will be high-through deficit spending and the accumulation of public debt to be repaid in the future.  In general, there is some logic to this argument, but the question is what level of deficit is sustainable.  The current deficit level is, in our assessment, too high to allow for further increase, due to the short-term marcoeconomic risks it entails.  In addition, deficit financing creates risks to the quality of project selection and of a loss of control over costs.  When public projects are financed without effective short-term budgetary restrictions that show the public and decision makers in real time what the cost of the sources required for the investment is, the risk of inefficient allocation of investments and excessive costs increases.\\nIn conclusion, these recommendations illustrate the material possibilities that we are presenting to policy makers to increase the standard of living in Israel.  I believe that their strength is in their interconnectedness and in their being sufficiently detailed in terms of the cost of realizing each item in the report.  Their concurrent implementation will maximize the chances of success of the project.  The report is available for viewing, and was already presented to the various government ministries as it was being formulated.\\nThank you."

The Border region where trade relationships are particularly close, is vulnerable with the strong inter-linkages between Irish and UK firms' supply chains.3\\nThe fall in the value of sterling has been the main channel which we have seen the economic effects of Brexit act to date and I am sure this has already had an impact on many of you and your businesses.\\nThe real effects of Brexit will of course only be known once the UK leaves the European Union, and fundamentally, the manner in which they depart.\\nAfter many years of close integration between the two economies as part of the EU, businesses and the Irish economy will need to adjust to new trading arrangements.\\nI look forward to discussing with you how Brexit may affect you, and how you have been preparing.\\nAny form of Brexit will be damaging for Ireland, with a \"no-deal\" Brexit especially so.\\nThe mission of the Central Bank of Ireland is to serve the public interest by safeguarding monetary and financial stability and by working to ensure that the financial system operates in the best interests of consumers and the wider economy.\\nRecognising the risks from Brexit, and in line with our mandate and mission, our work has focused on ensuring that the risks to the Irish economy are understood and that financial stability and consumer protection risks are identified and mitigated to the greatest extent possible. This is particularly pertinent for the \"cliff-edge\" risks associated with a hard or no-deal Brexit. We have also been working to ensure that regulated firms deliver on their responsibilities of preparing appropriately for these risks.\\nFor students of business, finance and accounting here in DkIT you will no doubt be following developments with interest. Brexit has forced us all to think about how we can be best prepared for such a disruptive event, not least the students of politics.\\nThe Central Bank supports the development of expertise in the fields of economics, business and finance, particularly for young people, such as the Central Bank of Ireland's Generation \\u20acuro Student's Award for young economists in Ireland which I will launch later today when I visit St. Mary's College.\\nThis competition gives us an opportunity to recognise excellence in the next generation.\\nIt also gives students the chance to build valuable life skills while challenging themselves to learn more about the work performed by the Central Bank of Ireland, the European Central Bank, and the Eurosystem more widely.\\nThey will learn how monetary policy decisions are taken to ensure stable prices, and how key economic policies affect our daily lives.\\nThe Central Bank of Ireland is also an employer of graduates, who have an opportunity to make a difference in the roles they undertake. Our three year programme has over 70 graduates working across regulation, central banking and operations. Our graduates come from a diverse range of backgrounds as we value the difference that people can bring. We will be coming to your career fair in DkIT on 16th October, so make time to come and talk to us.\\nI will now hand over to Mark Cassidy, the Central Bank's Director of Economics and Statistics who will give a short presentation, after which I look forward to an engaging discussion with you.\\nThank you.\\n1 As articulated by a colleague of mine on the Central Bank's Commission, Professor Alan Ahearne, here: https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/whitaker-s-work-is-as-relevant-as-ever-to-today-s-ireland-1.2896529\\n2 See https://www.dkit.ie/innovation-and-business/regional-development-centre.html\\n3 See Stephen Byrne and Jonathan Rice, (2018), 'Non-Tariff Barriers and Goods Trade: a Brexit Impact Analysis', Central Bank of Ireland, Research Technical Paper Vol. 2018, No. 7.

        "title": "Anita Angelovska Bezhoska: Opening address - Fifth Meeting of the Regional Working Group for Financial Education of Southeastern Europe",
        "content": "Distinguished representatives of the central banks,\\nDear representatives of international institutions,\\nDear guests, ladies and gentleman,\\nIt is my great pleasure to give the opening address at the Fifth Meeting of the Regional Working Group for Financial Education of Southeastern Europe, hosted by our national bank. I am more than certain that joint fora, such as this one, are important venue for raising our awareness and knowledge on matters of mutual interest. And, there is no dilemma that financial education, as a spotlight of this working group, is an issue of mutual interest gaining prominence and importance among all stakeholders - central banks, regulators, financial services providers, consumers. We are all faced with rapidly evolving financial landscape, in which being knowledgeable means being capable of reaping the benefits and mitigating risks.\\nNow allow me to shed some light on a couple of important dimensions such as relevance of the financial literacy and the benefits it brings to the society, the specific circumstances that brought this issue to the fore in the last decade, the role played by the central banks in this segment, the current state and the challenges ahead for the region and our country.\\nWhy does financial literacy matter? It is more than clear that the absence of understanding of the basic financial concepts erodes our capability to make proper and well-informed choices in terms of savings, investment, and borrowing. The costs of these choices are not confined only to individuals, but they can have systemic implications, eroding the overall financial stability. The translation of these misinformed decisions into systemic risks is exactly one of the main reasons why financial literacy became the mainstream in the past decade. The pre-crisis credit boom was supported by irrational exuberance and overconfidence of \"never ending\" rise in assets prices and low financing costs. The credit boom turned into credit bust, and the consequences of the \"bubble - burst\" are still with us. According to the latest IMF map of weak spots, heavily indebted households are still the main source of vulnerability in many systemically important advanced and emerging economies, and potential source of next financial crisis. Apparently, being financially literate and informed, can help in preventing, or at least mitigating the occurrence of such \"weak spots\". To bring the issue closer to the regional context, let me remind us of the \"episode\" of excessive borrowing in Swiss francs that occurred in several countries in the region (Hungary, Croatia, Serbia, Poland), amidst low interest rates and assumed stability of the exchange rate. Hence, the last crisis clearly demonstrated that many agents are not fully aware of the consequences of their financial decisions.\\nFinancial literacy is becoming even more relevant given the last decade's proliferation of the innovative services offered by new FinTech companies. The tighter regulatory grip on traditional sources of finance, on the one hand, and promotion of new alternative sources of finance underpinned by technology, on the other hand, have been conducive to emergence of array of new financial products and services. This promotes higher financial inclusion, but also exposes consumers to new risks. The fact that FinTech solutions can be very complex make the task of risk identification and mitigation by service providers and/or regulators difficult. According to \"Southeast Europe focus on Fintech and Innovation\" the FinTech is the fastest growing IT branch and the two largest FinTech segments in the region, each comprising a quarter of all FinTech companies, are payments services and crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending. Over the last couple of years, this trend has even led to discussions for risk of financial exclusion in case financial education does not keep pace with financial innovations. It asks for a greater vigilance, awareness and knowledge by all of the stakeholders on the possibilities it offers, but on the risks and threats as well.\\nGoing beyond the importance for the well-being of the individuals and the overall financial stability, financial literacy can play an important role in increasing the domestic savings, which is one of the key factors in speeding up the real convergence in the region. Although in the recent period domestic savings has been picking up, still in most of the economies in the region it remains below the adequate levels needed to support stronger investments and increase the long-term potential of the economies. This is particularly relevant given the changing business models of the banks that imply a lower reliance on external sources of finance that may pose constraints for stronger credit support. Higher financial knowledge may also contribute to higher savings in capital market instruments and thus provide more balanced structure of corporate sector financing. Currently, the capital market depth in the region is hovering around 50% of GDP, being far below the EU average of around 200% of GDP.\\nOne of the Vienna Initiative reports highlights the importance of financial literacy for capital markets not just from the savings point of view (demand side), but also from the supply side. According to their estimates, financial literacy level is one of the three key factors that explain the lower use of alternative sources of financing in the region in comparison with the EU average. This once again proves that the need for financial education regionwide is indeed widespread, which means necessity of a larger scope of our activities, including the corporate sector, especially the small and medium-sized enterprises.\\nFurthermore, the financial literacy supports the ongoing process of raising financial inclusion, which is deemed to be an important dimension for having stronger, sustainable and more inclusive growth where the benefits are shared by the wider community. The necessity for stronger financial knowledge and financial inclusion is undisputable. It is important for curbing risks, and unleashing the potential of the economies to grow.\\nBut, what is the current state of play? Data shows that notable gaps exists and there is a long way to go. International institutions reports indicate that Southeast European countries are lagging behind developed economies in terms of financial literacy and inclusion, despite their efforts to actively address these issues. According to the financial literacy surveys pursuant to the standard methodology of the International Network on Financial Education at the OECD (INFE-OECD), on average 62% of the population of the OECD countries achieved the minimum target score for financial knowledge, while in Southeast European region, this percentage was lower and amounted to 40-55%. Despite the fact that the level of financial inclusion, measured as a percentage of adult population holding a bank account, has been increasing, in the SEE region it is still lower when compared to some of the more advanced countries in the wider CESEE region. The data from the Global Findex database of the World Bank, points to a percentage of 77% in 2017 for our country, lower than that compared to Croatia (86%), Slovenia (98%), Latvia (93%), Estonia (98%). According to the Standard & Poor's Global Financial Literacy Survey, the average difference in the rank is around 20 places between the countries of the region and the EU-15 countries.\\nWhat role as central banks do we have in elevating financial literacy? Given the lessons learned from the crisis and the evolving financial innovations, in the last decade central banks have played an increasing role in the coordinated activities of the national policymakers tilted towards financial education and inclusion. Hence, central banks are active participants and promoters of the financial education process in almost all countries. The benefits are apparent: educated entities estimate risks and understand monetary policy stance better, the better the understanding of the economy and finances, the smoother the functioning of financial markets; the more efficient financial markets; the stronger monetary policy transmission and the credibility of the central bank.\\nIn this context, let me briefly touch upon several activities our institution has embarked on in this area. Financial education and financial inclusion have formally become part of our agenda. We have widened the scope of educational activities, by wider portfolio of educational articles, more inclusive approach to financial education and closer cooperation with other regulators. The National Bank supported the organization of the European Money Quiz for teenagers with educational activities for the teaching staff, and has been proud of our high school students who won the second place in Europe. Very importantly, there is an ongoing process of preparation of the National Strategy for Financial Education and Inclusion, which we believe will pave the way for more educated and more inclusive society.\\nDear guests,\\nThis workshop proves that apart from national initiatives to elevate and promote financial knowledge, regional initiatives are on board as well. I think this approach provides synergy; employs joint resources and enables more efficient achievement of the vision that we all share.\\nI am pleased that we will formalize our commitment and readiness for joint action with the first Memorandum of Cooperation in the field of financial education and financial inclusion in Southeastern Europe. We must all strive to be strongly committed, not only to declare, but also to enable efficient implementation in practice. No doubts I have, that this will be the case.\\nAt the end of my address, on behalf of all the stakeholders, I would like to express sincere gratitude to INFE-OECD and EFSE for their support all these years. It is unquestionable that many of the activities we have taken so far would have been difficult to carry out without their support. I truly hope that we justify the trust given to us.\\nThe mission that we have is important, as by supporting financial literacy, we support provision of public good. In doing so, we must not forget that \"Financial literacy is not an end in itself, but a step-by-step process. It begins in childhood and continues throughout a person's life all the way to retirement\" - George Karl. Therefore, we must be consistent, inclusive, committed and patient while playing our role in the financial education of our society.\\nI wish you a successful and fruitful meeting.\\nThank you. "

        "title": "Yannis Stournaras: Building public-private partnerships",
        "content": "Ladies and Gentlemen,\\nIt is my great pleasure to take part in this highly interesting discussion on the subject of building public-private partnerships at the 30-year Anniversary Conference held by the IMD World Competitiveness Center.\\nIn my speech today, I will briefly talk about the importance of establishing effective partnerships between the public and the private sector and how governments can create the conditions for their success. But first let me highlight some of my own views on the key features of Greece's performance and its current state of play.\\n***\\nAs I will outline, the 2019 IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook makes for sobering reading as far as Greece is concerned, given the indications that the country so far failed to make headway in areas on which sustainable economic growth increasingly depends. Greece also has so far shown signs of slippage in key dimensions against a group of advanced high-income economies that have already managed to make a transition to a development that is based more on factors related to efficiency and productivity. And all these, despite the impressive progress that Greece has made since the beginning of the crisis in 2010 in the fiscal front, in the banking sector, in social security reform, in unit labour cost competitiveness, and in labour and product market liberalization.\\nLooking at the 2019 Yearbook, my first observation is that little appears to have changed in the last five years. In all five main pillars covered by the IMD Competitiveness index, Greece has been trending downwards, falling by a cumulative 8 ranks in the overall index, from 50th place in 2015 to 58th place in 2019. At the same time, the country continues to lose ground in the \"knowledge\", \"technology\" and \"future readiness\" dimensions, as reported in the IMD World Competitiveness Digital Ranking 2018. These three factors are considered key to meeting long term objectives. Still, there is room for optimism, given (a) the strength of Greece's \"skilled workforce\" and \"high educational level\", as reported in the Executive Opinion Survey and in the IMD World Talent Ranking 2018, and (b) the fact that a new government was elected last July with a programme to invest in the so called \"knowledge triangle\" (education-research-innovation), to liberalise further product and services markets, to promote Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), to attract foreign direct investment, to promote privatisations, to bring back to life large investment projects that had been \"frozen\" for a number of years and to tackle the problem of Non-Performing-Loans (NPLs), which is one of the most serious legacies of the crisis.\\nThe 2019 Yearbook and other similar reports show that, despite the progress made so far, Greece still needs to address major challenges and crisis-related legacies.\\nThe multi-year recession has left an investment gap and risks permanently impairing the productive capacity of the Greek economy through a hysteresis effect. Estimates by the Bank of Greece indicate that the net capital stock of the Greek economy (at constant 2010 prices) declined by \\u20ac67.4 billion in the period 2010-2016, to \\u20ac622.2 billion in 2016. In order to raise the net capital stock over the next decade to pre-crisis levels, gross fixed capital formation at constant prices, excluding residential investment, needs to increase by about 5% per year. Although this is a high growth rate, it is deemed achievable for the Greek economy based on historical experience, so long as suitable investment and business-friendly policies are pursued.\\nForeign direct investment (FDI) is necessary, as domestic savings are insufficient to match the investments needed for high growth rates. Up to now, the business environment had not been considered investment-friendly, in fact it had discouraged investment. This was mainly the result of high tax rates, weak public sector efficiency, red-tape and delays in court proceedings and rulings. If Greece wants to attract more FDI, it must step up the pace of structural reforms and privatisations.\\nMeanwhile, an important conclusion that can be drawn from the international rankings concerns innovation, supported by investment in human capital. Factors related to human capital can be divided into the ability to attract talent, the determination to maintain and enrich it, and the capacity to disseminate knowledge. So it is not hard to see where Greece's main problems lie. Greece has high-quality human resources and enclaves of excellence both in public research institutes and in the private sector. However, Greece lags behind in its transition to a knowledge-based economy. The high-quality research output does not translate into growth output, leading to a paradox of non-commercialisation. Strengthening the linkages between industry and universities would enhance the so-called \"knowledge triangle\" and lead to the digital transformation of the economy, an increase in the stock of knowledge and productive capital, the development of outward-oriented sectors and, more generally, to a knowledge economy and society.\\n***\\nPublic-Private Partnerships\\nFour decades ago, inequality started to rise in the OECD member-states. The 21st century ushered in new challenges like the prospects of powerful new technologies that gave rise to higher productive capacity but, also, concentration of economic power and inequality of opportunities. The key role of governments was to create a well-functioning market economy, which can be perceived as synonymous with a competitive economy. The top priority was, and still remains, to restore economic dynamism through appropriate supply and demand policies as well as to ensure equality of opportunity for all. In this vein, establishing partnerships with the private sector is no longer a matter for theoretical discussion, it must become common practice.\\nGreece, in the past ten years has had a rather good track record in building PPPs. Across a range of sectors, PPPs have played a significant role in facilitating the delivery of important projects. Currently, Greece is involved in 14 public-private partnerships of various types and sizes, which translate into an investment of \\u20ac822 million over the years 2009 to 2019, of which \\u20ac318 million financed by EU grants and \\u20ac504 million by private resources.\\nLet me elaborate on some of these projects. The \"Attica Urban Transportation Telematics System\" project, signed in June 2014, involved 1,000 smart bus and trolley stops, providing passengers with real-time information on the schedules and routes of 2,500 vehicles. The social and economic benefits of the project were significant: (a) upgrading of public transport infrastructure; (b) improvements of passenger experience and quality of life; (c) reductions in traffic congestion, fuel consumption and, therefore, air pollution.\\nIn December 2014, another partnership was signed to provide broadband infrastructure coverage and affordable connectivity services to the residents of remote, disadvantaged and border areas of Greece with no connection to the digital world and corresponding to roughly 45% of Greek territory. This particular project was the winner of the European Broadband Awards 2017.\\nIn June 2015, a new public-private partnership was established to develop the first integrated waste management system in Greece. This new waste treatment unit encompasses the previously existing waste management system of Western Macedonia, and creates a waste management model in full conformity with the environmental strategy of the EU.\\nAll 14 public-private partnerships adhere to high standards, as regards both financial reporting standards and technical features, and have received wide recognition, not to mention a number of international awards. Importantly, they have been evaluated by Eurostat and classified as 'off-balance sheet' (meaning that they do not affect the government deficit and public debt) due to the good risk-sharing between the entities.1\\nAn additional 12 public-private partnerships are presently in the pipeline and have already been approved. Their emphasis is on areas of high social priority for local communities, such as waste management, energy saving (for example, street lighting projects), social infrastructure (for example, schools and hospitals) and ICT (for example, the \"Ultrafast Broadband\" project) and on concession projects that do not burden the Public Investment Programme.\\nBut even more important could turn out to be in the future PPPs that have to do with large investment projects. The Greek state, for historical reasons, owns land to a much larger extent than other OECD or European member-states. This land could be used to initiate large investment projects (and attract foreign direct investment) where the state leases the land for long periods and private investors develop it. For example, the \"Hellinikon\" project, an 8 bl euros giga project, concerns the development of a large area (three times the size of Monaco) in the southern suburbs of Athens by the sea, which used to be the national airport of Greece. The ambition is to create there a new \"Riviera\" with large multiplier effects through the construction of luxury residencies, hotels and a casino.\\nThe benefits of PPPs.\\nFirst, public-private partnerships enable the public sector to leverage more financial resources. And since there is no immediate disbursement of public funds, this in turn allows government funds to be redirected to other important uses.\\nSecond, in any public-private partnership scheme, the private sector assumes a significant part of the risks involved. Thus, it has a keen interest in ensuring the project's diligent and efficient design and implementation. The use of private funds, complementary to public ones, can then contribute to a faster completion of the project and provision of services.\\nThird, the private entity involved is responsible for the proper maintenance of the work or service. Specific performance indices are used to monitor the projects and are linked with the terms and conditions of payment specified in the contracts. In other words, if certain performance targets are not met on time, the penalty typically entails payment reductions, retentions, or credit to the owner, thus ensuring a strong incentive for the long-term maintenance of a sound technical project and high-quality services.\\nFourth, the long-term nature of contracts has the indirect effect of creating financially stable firms. The objective is to secure not only additional funding but also to leverage on private sector's know-how, human resources, innovative approach and ability to efficiently manage complex projects for the public benefit.\\nLast but not least, public-private partnerships have the potential to play a fundamental role in achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.\\nAccording to the United Nations, a sustainable future hinges on the achievement of 17 goals by 2030, including global prosperity with no poverty and zero hunger, quality education, equality, decent work, access to clean water, affordable energy, justice, strong institutions and climate action. Achieving these goals will, however, require substantially more investment, both public and private, and a reorientation of that investment. In particular, it is estimated that the financing required to achieve the sustainable development goals by 2030 amounts to about $5-7 trillion per year globally. Global infrastructure (water, road and rail transportation, airports and ports, energy) could require up to $94 trillion of investment by 2040, which corresponds to 3.5% of global GDP.2\\nGiven the limited government resources, a considerable amount of private finance will be required to fill the gap. More importantly, to meet the Sustainable Development Goals, partnerships at every level will be required. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development calls for a new partnership or a \"revitalized global partnership for sustainable development\" and, as Goal 17 states, \"effective public, public-private and civil society partnerships\" will be required to strengthen the means of implementing the Sustainable Development Goals.\\nI would like to seize this opportunity to stress how strongly Greece is committed to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Goals, while ensuring that \"no one is left behind\" is a high policy priority. In 2017, Greece endorsed eight National Priorities for adapting the 17 Sustainable Development Goals to national needs and circumstances. The 8th priority was \"enhancing open, participatory, democratic processes and promoting partnerships\".\\nGiven that on the path to sustainable development lies the environmental challenge, the Bank of Greece has committed to invest significantly in Goal 13, i.e. climate action, a horizontal goal that contributes to the achievement of all others. As addressing the challenge of climate change calls for coordinated efforts, the Bank of Greece, through its Climate Change Impacts Study Committee (CCISC), is currently involved in an eight-year programme with the Greek Ministry of Environment and Energy and other partners for the implementation of the national adaptation strategy for Greece. The Bank of Greece is also building a stakeholders' network to bring together academia, the public and the financial sectors in stepping up the collective effort to address issues of climate change and adaptation.\\nLet us now examine what makes a public-private partnership successful.\\nPublic-private partnerships need to be commercially viable schemes in order to attract private sector investment, and there is already good guidance on how public-private partnerships can deliver the value-for-money approach when selecting projects.\\nPublic-private partnerships are just one way to deliver public infrastructure and services. This means that they should not be seen as a \"deus ex machina\", only stepping in to make up for limitations in public funds to cover investment needs, but also as a way to increase the quality and efficiency of public services. When well designed and implemented, public-private partnerships increase access to capital, foster innovation and produce more efficient public services. They also bring into the projects a business culture oriented towards efficiency, quality and economic viability.\\nPublic-private partnerships are gaining a solid foothold, but face quite a few impediments and challenges. According to the United Nations, public-private partnerships serve as an instrument for financing key economic infrastructure projects and deliver value for money, but only if countries have in place the institutional capacity to create, manage, evaluate and monitor them. These four interrelated capacities ensure that public-private partnerships are undertaken for the \"right\" reason.3 The design of a proper legal framework and of contractual arrangements is crucial to make public private partnerships live up to their potential.\\nThis brings me to the next question: what actions can governments take?\\nUltimately, building successful partnerships is equivalent to building trust between public and private entities. It is often said that successful partnerships require both parties to have \"shared goals\". However, since this is very hard to achieve when it comes to public-private partnerships, the focus should rather be on \"complementary goals\". Misalignment, which includes conflicting goals and incentives, is identified as one of the three major reasons for failure of strategic partnerships.4 This is where governments have an important role to play. Governments must create the enabling environment in which partnerships can emerge, and moreover, they must develop sufficient regulatory and assessment capacity to ensure that projects actually provide a public good. The more transparent the objectives, targets, and impacts of the projects are, the more effective the partnership will be. In this context, policy actions should focus more than ever on good governance, sound institutions, respect for property rights and legal predictability. It is the responsibility of the public sector to establish a reliable and credible institutional framework.\\nAll around us, we see the power of technology to challenge, disrupt and improve the status quo. Today, the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is expanding public-private partnerships beyond all previous limitations and boundaries. The relationship between public-private partnerships and ICT can be described as symbiotic. The deployment of ICT has the power to improve the services that matter most to people's lives: education, transportation, public safety, healthcare and social services. In order to transform the way these public services are delivered, governments can collaborate with private corporations to develop such initiatives as e-government, remote healthcare, and intelligent transport.\\nA transformative innovation policy is essential to sustainable growth. Fostering linkages in the national innovation system has in recent years become a major policy focus, and public-private partnerships can become a major policy instrument. Providing education services and improving learning outcomes is just one area where the public and private sectors can join forces to complement each other's strengths. For one, making high-quality education accessible to all, calls for innovative programmes and initiatives, in addition to public resources and leadership. In higher education in particular, partnerships with the private sector can, when undertaken properly, benefit all parties. For instance, the curriculum, which is at the core of higher education, when developed by education experts and with input and feedback from the social partners, stands a better chance of leading to better career prospects.\\nAs a final remark, I would like to stress that SMEs are the backbone of the European economy and that the 2030 agenda places micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) at the heart of the partnership debate. Not only do they employ the vast majority of people in most EU countries, but also their role as incubators of innovation and inclusive growth is increasingly recognised. These SMEs need support to build their competitiveness.\\n***\\nIn closing, isolationism is not a viable option. The interdependence of economies, value chains, production processes and the increased use of technology have made obsolete the notion of  going it alone. Collaboration with the private sector will be critical to bringing additional capacity and transformation on the ground. It can also play an important role as a source of innovative technologies, management and organisational skills and enhanced capabilities.\\nPrivate sector, the academia and institutions are all needed to build a compact of active partnerships. Smart partnerships can bring multiple wins for all involved in the medium and long term, where efforts of today can create opportunities for tomorrow.\\n1 Eurostat (2019), \"Manual on Government Deficit and Debt - Implementation of ESA 2010\".\\n2 Global Infrastructure Outlook, Oxford Economics.\\n3 United Nations (2016), \"Public-Private Partnerships and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development: Fit for Purpose, DESA Working Paper No 148.\\n4 Henderson, J., Dhanaraj, C., Perrinjaquet, M. and Avagyan, K.

        "title": "Jerome H Powell: Opening remarks - \"Perspectives on Maximum Employment and Price Stability\"",
        "content": "Good afternoon. Welcome to the room where members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the 12 Reserve Banks meet eight times a year-most recently, two weeks ago-to decide the stance of monetary policy. It's a magnificent, formal-perhaps even imposing-room, with 26-foot ceilings, a monumental marble fireplace, and a 1,000-pound brass and glass chandelier. It's seen a lot of history since Franklin Roosevelt dedicated this building in 1937. British and American military leaders conferred here during World War II. And, through the decades, our Federal Reserve predecessors grappled with financial turmoil and the economy's ups and downs. So when my colleagues and I take our assigned places around this polished mahogany and granite table, the setting and its history lends a certain formality-dare I say, stuffiness-to the proceedings.\\nAs we kick off this 12th of 14 Fed Listens events, Governor Brainard, Governor Bowman, and I hope that today's meeting is anything but stuffy. Candid and serious, yes. But not stuffy. The Reserve Banks and the Board have been holding Fed Listens events around the country as part of a comprehensive and public review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications practices. Almost all of the Fed Listens meetings, like this one, have been open to the press and live-streamed on the internet. Both the breadth and transparency of the review are unprecedented for us.\\nOne reason we are conducting this review is that it is always a good practice for any organization to occasionally take a step back and ask if it could be doing its job more effectively. But we must pose that question not just to ourselves. Because Congress has granted the Federal Reserve significant protections from short-term political pressures, we have an obligation to clearly explain what we are doing and why. And we have an obligation to actively engage the people we serve so that they and their elected representatives can hold us accountable.\\nWe've invited you here because we want to better understand how monetary policy affects the lives of the people your organizations represent-union members, small business owners, residents of low- and moderate-income communities, retirees, and others. We want to hear your perspective on maximum employment and price stability-the monetary policy goals Congress has assigned us.\\nNow is a good time to conduct the review. Unemployment is near a half-century low, and inflation is running close to, but a bit below, our 2 percent objective. While not everyone fully shares economic opportunities and the economy faces some risks, overall it is-as I like to say-in a good place. Our job is to keep it there as long as possible. While we believe our strategy and tools have been and remain effective, the U.S. economy, like other advanced economies around the world, is facing some longer-term challenges-from low growth, low inflation, and low interest rates. While slow growth is obviously not good, you may be asking, \"What's wrong with low inflation and low interest rates?\" Low can be good, but when inflation-and, consequently, interest rates-are too low, the Fed and other central banks have less room to cut rates to support the economy during downturns.\\nSo, in this review, we are examining strategies that might better allow us to symmetrically and sustainably achieve 2 percent inflation. Doing so would help prevent inflation expectations among consumers, businesses, and investors from slipping too low, as they appear to have done in several advanced economies. More-firmly anchored expectations, in a virtuous circle, would help keep actual inflation around our target, thus preserving our ability to change interest rates as appropriate to meet our mandate. We are also looking at whether our existing monetary policy tools will be adequate when the next downturn comes. Finally, we are asking whether our communications practices can be improved to better support the effectiveness of our policy.\\nAfter today, we have two Fed Listens sessions remaining, both later this month: one in Kansas City and another in Chicago. At the July meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, my colleagues and I began discussing what we've learned so far from the Fed Listens events. We continued that discussion at our September meeting and have a lot left to do. We plan to publicly report our conclusions during the first half of next year.\\nOne clear takeaway of the sessions so far is the importance of sustaining our historically strong job market. People from low- and moderate-income communities tell us this long recovery, now in its 11th year, is benefiting them and their neighbors to a degree that has not been felt for many years. Employers are partnering with community colleges and nonprofit organizations to offer training. And people who have struggled to stay in the workforce in the past are getting new opportunities.\\nOnce again, welcome. Now it is your turn to speak. We're listening."

        "content": "Tools helped to avert a deflationary spiral but came with lingering side-effects\\nThe global financial crisis presented central banks with unprecedented challenges, and their response was to take extraordinary actions. A decade on, we can say that these measures succeeded in saving the global economy from deflation, but also introduced some distortions in a few areas of the capital markets.\\nMany central banks introduced unconventional monetary policy tools following the crisis. They embarked on large-scale asset purchases and expanded lending programmes, increasing their balance sheets to historic levels. Interest rates were cut below zero in several countries. Two committees at the Bank for International Settlements released complementary reports today assessing the effectiveness of unconventional monetary policy instruments and analysing the impact of large central bank balance sheets on market functioning.\\nUnconventional policy tools emerged out of necessity. In the countries hardest hit by the economic crisis, the financial sector stalled and stopped doing its job, hamstrung by losses and drained of liquidity. The subsequent recession sent unemployment soaring. With inflation and interest rates at low levels, the limited room for conventional policy manoeuvre was quickly exhausted.\\nOn balance, central bankers say that the results of unconventional policies have been positive. Interventions helped smooth investor and consumer expectations and jump-start markets. Research by bankers and academics points to a positive response of economic activity to the extra stimulus provided by unconventional tools. The risk of a deflationary spiral was largely avoided, though inflation still undershot central bank objectives.\\nBalance sheet-expanding policies aimed at improving market functioning delivered on this front. Balance sheet policies aiming primarily to provide monetary stimulus had some side-effects on market functioning.\\nThe path has been neither smooth nor straight, and some policies have been more successful than others. The reports conclude that corrections to the initial plans were necessary in view of the experience gathered in the course of implementation. Balance sheet policies aiming primarily to provide monetary stimulus had some side-effects on market functioning - especially in terms of reducing the availability of bonds in the market - which were addressed by central bank countermeasures.\\nIn addition, the style of central bank communication about policy intentions and use of these tools had to be adjusted to changing circumstances and fine-tuned to the interpretations that market participants gave to policy messages. Monetary policy is a powerful but not very precise tool and prolonged easing can have side-effects. In part, it works by stimulating aggregate expenditure in a slump by encouraging investors and consumers, who have become overly cautious, to take more risk. Unconventional tools work the same way and, as the reports discuss, protracted use may also encourage imprudent behaviour by market participants.\\nIn a world with open financial borders, it also has spillovers. Investors obtaining cheap funding at home can seek returns abroad, and recipient economies need to manage capital flows in a way that is consistent with their own priorities and needs.\\nThe central banks that used unconventional policies report that these tools have earned a place in their policymakers' toolbox. They can provide additional policy space and flexibility, allowing a central bank to achieve its mandate when conventional tools have reached their limits. In a world of low inflation and structurally low real rates, they may become increasingly important.\\nAnother lesson is that the tools need to be complemented with measures that reduce side-effects. Such measures could include securities lending facilities that mitigate the scarcity effects from central bank asset purchases, and policies that reduce the impact of negative rates on banks funded by retail deposits.\\nMoney markets must maintain sufficient capacity to function after the extraordinary liquidity is withdrawn, and central banks must preserve operational flexibility to address unexpected changes. Central banks also need to strike the right balance between providing guidance that reduces uncertainty and unduly narrowing down central bankers' options to respond to changing circumstances in the future.\\nThe reports suggest that unconventional tools' effectiveness can be strengthened if central banks communicate that they are willing and able to use them. This is best done in a way consistent with each bank's legal mandate and institutional framework.\\nCentral bank credibility is a major determinant of the effectiveness of monetary policy and this applies as well in the use of unconventional tools. At the same time, their use is best seen as one component of an overall public policy framework that encompasses fiscal and prudential policy responses. Policymakers should avoid placing a disproportionate burden on monetary policy."

        "content": "Thank you for the invitation. It is good to be back at the GCF. 2011-2014, I served as a member of the Transitional Committee and the Board. Today, I will focus on the role of financing and regulators in the context of broader policies to mitigate and adapt to man-made climate change. \\nThis past year has seen stronger engagement in climate issues around the world. This is most welcome. There has been better engagement by the financial industry. Central bankers and financial regulators are now involved in addressing climate-related financial risks. The climate challenge is so large that all players in our economies, all areas of policy, and all countries in the world will have to deliver and push in the same direction.\\nWe need to be aware of the context. Others are better placed to consider developments in emissions and the setting of targets for future reductions. My perspective is the policies needed to meet objectives. \\nI remember the early 1990s, almost thirty years ago. We understood the climate impact of CO2 emissions, and we began assessing how economic scenarios affected emissions. The policy implication was pretty clear: Announce a credible path of gradually increasing carbon pricing to set expectations right without affecting already undertaken investments by firms and households too much. That has not happened. \\nAn appropriate pricing of fossil fuels, in line with the true costs of CO2 emissions, would still be the most efficient driver of the needed climate-friendly innovation, investment and behavioural change of billions of people and hundreds of millions of firms. That behavioural change is needed to incentivise the rolling out of existing and upcoming technologies. We need more information on policies setting emissions, country by country. But we know that the current average direct global price of carbon is 2 USD per ton, approximately zero. Only about 20 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions are covered by a carbon price. Only a fraction hereof is priced at levels consistent with the Paris Agreement. The price of most CO2-intensive products, such as oil, gas and electricity, etc., is in some cases raised by close proxies of direct carbon pricing, such as fuel taxes. In other cases, the price of such products is reduced by fossil fuel subsidies. Likely, the net impact of taxes and subsidies is close to zero. \\nThe absence of any significant carbon pricing has implications. First, it will be significantly more difficult to cut emissions in the absence of spectacular technological advances, which we yet have to see. Second, in addition to the cost implied by physical effects of climate change - such as flooding and droughts - the economic cost of mitigation will be substantially higher than if driven by price incentives. Regulated energy and emission standards have a significant potential, but are less efficient. Third, we have to hope, if we do not promote, that technological advances have a climate-friendly bias. This may well have been the case in recent years as the costs of renewable energy and energy savings have come down substantially and are now competitive. But many of us underestimated the technological advances also taking place in the extraction of fossil fuels, such as shale gas and deep water drilling. \\nAs regards financing, climate-friendly investments would have been more attractive in a world of appropriate pricing and regulation of carbon. The absence of such policy action implies that we cannot expect financing to deliver as much as we would like. Attracting financing on a large scale requires a strong enabling environment. Investors seek the highest risk-adjusted return. But the financial sector and financial authorities can and should nevertheless complement the fight against climate change, also with current public policy settings. \\nWhat are the opportunities from the financial sector perspective?  First, lots of profitable climate-friendly investment projects exist already. Some on a large scale. In my country of origin, Denmark, we have numerous encouraging examples of companies and institutional investors contributing to and benefiting from the transition to a low-carbon economy - both at home and abroad. Others on a small scale; simple efforts to save energy in households and firms. Note that the low interest rate environment has shifted the investment balance in favour of upfront efficient capital and against outlays for energy year after year. Second, the financial sector has to care about reputational risks. It will get questions from customers and the  media. Banks begin to check companies for their ESG strategies before lending, out of concern for both risks and reputation. Third, the financial sector should prepare for potentially stronger  climate-friendly policies set by governments down the line. \\nObvious and profitable climate-friendly investment needs often exist in areas of the world with difficult physical, economic or regulatory environments. Such barriers can be reduced with technical assistance. These are areas where also the GCF and other international financing institutions can have an important positive impact. I am encouraged by what I have learnt about the GCF activities since I left in 2014, and share the strong plea that all countries scale up their support for the GCF.\\nWhat is the role of central banks and financial regulators as regards climate change issues? The Network for Greening the Financial System, NGFS, is a recognition of the need for global collective leadership and co-ordinated action to effectively mitigate and adapt to climate change. Central banks and financial supervisors take part, and my central bank is a member. We are in particular aiming to improve our understanding of how climate-related risks may impact the financial system and the wider economy. Many questions have yet to be answered, but we are working to map the implications of climate change to better safeguard the financial system against these risks. \\nClimate-related risks are unlikely to be sufficiently reflected in financial balance sheets and asset prices. This is the case for both physical and transitional risks. Physical risks relate to for example droughts or flooding, while transitional risks arise from policy changes and technological advances which may inter alia shift the prices of assets, leaving some stranded. By nature, the impact of transition risks will increase, the more abrupt the transition to a low-carbon economy takes place. The longer we delay, and we are very late by now, the more abrupt these changes will have to be. The more abrupt change, the more pronounced the potential effect on the financial system. Risks should be addressed prudently from a financial stability perspective. Neither green nor brown investments and loans should receive special treatment which would undermine the credibility of risk weights. Rather, we should ensure that exposure to actual risks from climate change and the necessary climate-friendly economic restructuring is correctly accounted for. This would also send a strong signal to those who seek finance for their activities. \\nIn conclusion, none of us - neither in the public nor private sector - can afford to overlook the risks associated with climate change as well as the need for immediate and effective policies and action. The financial sector can supplement fiscal and energy policies to fight climate change. But be careful that those who set fiscal and energy policies do not come to think that financial institutions, central banks and supervisors can substitute for their efforts. We all have to push and pull in the same direction. Thank you for your attention. I am looking forward to engaging with all of you at this conference. "

        "title": "\\xd8ystein Olsen: The monetary policy toolkit",
        "content": "Accompanying charts of the speech.\\nIntroduction\\nIn the wake of the financial crisis, central banks in many countries have stretched the limits of monetary policy. New, alternative policy instruments were introduced. Interest rates are still negative in many countries.\\nApart from in the initial hectic months after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, resorting to alternative monetary policy tools has not been necessary in Norway. Nor is there anything, in our assessment of the outlook, to suggest it would be appropriate to do so in the future. But there are no guarantees that the economy will not experience pronounced downturns in the future. Were that to occur, it would be wise to have thought through which instruments could function in Norway. Norges Bank has therefore assessed the tools that might be useful in the monetary policy toolkit.\\nTo some extent, our assessments can build on the post-crisis experiences of other countries. In some areas that are important for the impact of monetary policy, however, Norway is different from other countries. This could mean that some of the most widely used alternative tools in other countries are not a suitable option for us. I would like to share with you some of our thinking on this subject in my speech today.\\nAn assessment of which tools that might be useful will partly depend on the specific features of the Norwegian credit and financial markets and partly on the shocks that hit our economy. The tools we resort to in a crisis may be less suitable in a normal situation. Gains must be weighed against costs. This brings us to some key interrelated questions: what should the level of ambition for monetary policy be, and how far should the limits of monetary policy be stretched before other components of economic policy must take over?\\nConventional monetary policy - how much room for manoeuvre is there?\\nChart: The policy rate in Norway\\nFirst, a few words on our most important monetary policy instrument - the policy rate. Since the trough at 0.5 percent, the policy rate has been gradually raised to 1.5 percent, reflecting favourable developments in the Norwegian economy.\\nIn our September interest rate forecast, the policy rate remains close to today's level of 1.5 percent for the next couple of years. On the one hand, growth in the Norwegian economy is still solid, inflation is close to the target and capacity utilisation is somewhat above a normal level. On the other hand, there is considerable uncertainty about the global growth outlook. The policy rate path reflects a trade-off between these conditions.\\nChart: Low policy rates abroad\\nA rate of 1.5 percent is considerably lower than the average level for the policy rate since inflation targeting was introduced in 2001. This must be viewed in the context of persistently low policy rates among Norway's trading partners. Weighting our trading partners together, we find an expected policy rate of close to zero at the end of 2022. Among some of Norway's main trading partners, market rates are negative for maturities as long as ten years.\\nDespite persistently low interest rates, there are few signs of pressures in our trading partners' economies. Although unemployment in the US, euro area and the UK has fallen steadily for several years, and to somewhat below pre-crisis levels, wage growth remains moderate and inflation is below target for a number of our neighbours.\\nChart: Unemployment and inflation in selected countries\\nThe combination of persistently low interest rates, moderate economic growth and low inflation suggests that headwinds have dampened the effect of the monetary policy measures. These conditions can be purely temporary, such as high uncertainty contributing to increased saving and low willingness to invest. But the forces at work are also of a more structural kind, rooted in demographic trends, wider income gaps and global downward pressure on wages for large groups of workers. Regardless, the consequence seems to be that the interest rate level that is consistent with normal growth and inflation, ie what we refer to as the neutral interest rate, has fallen to a low level. How long this will persist is difficult to predict. But an environment in which borrowing is free and the real interest rate is considerably lower than trend growth in the economy is unlikely to be sustainable over time.\\nChart: Estimates of the neutral interest rate\\nThe neutral interest rate cannot be observed and must be estimated. In the Bank's Monetary Policy Report, the current neutral real interest rate in Norway is assumed to be around zero. The estimate is based on calculations from a range of different models. As we can see in the chart, these calculations show that the neutral interest rate has fallen to a historically low level close to zero over the past 20 years. With an inflation target of 2 percent, this means that setting the policy rate at zero would enable us to bring the real interest rate down to 2 percentage points below its equilibrium level.1 2\\nIn Norges Bank's assessment, monetary policy has sufficient room for manoeuvre with an inflation target of 2 percent. First, international experience has shown that the room for manoeuvre in monetary policy is not exhausted when the policy rate is close to zero. I will come back to this. Second, our calculations show that over the past 20 years, the real interest rate has normally remained less than 2 percentage points away from its estimated equilibrium level.3 This may suggest that a real interest rate that is 2 percentage points below equilibrium has in most cases provided sufficient economic stimulus. \\nChart: The real interest rate minus the neutral real interest rate\\nHowever, both in 2004 and following the financial crisis in 2008, the real interest rate was almost 2 percentage points lower than the estimated normal interest rate, with a somewhat larger gap after the fall in oil prices in 2014. Looking back, we can safely say that the Norwegian economy fared relatively well through these downturns, with some help from other factors. After the financial crisis, high oil investment cushioned the downturn, and in 2014 a weaker krone gave the economy an extra boost. In addition, fiscal policy provided substantial support in both cases.\\nA future severe downturn could have a greater impact, with more pronounced declines in both employment and inflation. We must therefore take into account that situations could arise that require measures other than cutting the policy rate towards zero. So we should examine the contents of the monetary policy toolkit in Norway and ask not only when the tools should be used, but also how far the limits of monetary policy should be stretched in such a situation.\\nThe policy rate\\nThe policy rate is the key monetary policy instrument. Monetary policy is effective when changes in the policy rate pass through to market rates. Monetary policy is more effective when central banks successfully influence interest rate expectations.\\nA downturn in the Norwegian economy should initially be countered by lowering the policy rate. Owing to the characteristics specific to the Norwegian credit market, policy rate cuts quickly result in lower borrowing costs for households and enterprises. One characteristic is that most households prefer floating-rate loans. We need look no further than to Sweden to find a considerably lower share of floating-rate loans than in Norway. In the UK and Germany, only a small minority show the same preference as Norwegian households.\\nChart: Share of floating-rate loans - new mortgages\\nAnother characteristic of the Norwegian credit market is that a large share of corporate financing is obtained via banks and often at floating rates.\\nChanges in the policy rate will pass through to banks' funding costs through short-term money market rates. The high share of Norwegian loans issued at floating rates has its counterpart in banks' preference for floating-rate funding. Fixed-rate payments on bank bonds are typically swapped for floating-rate payments in the derivatives market. In addition, most retail deposits pay interest at a floating rate. Under normal conditions, changes in funding conditions will in the next round be passed on to banks' retail borrowers.\\nThus, the structure of the Norwegian credit market makes changing the policy rate an effective tool. But how far can the policy rate be lowered before monetary policy loses its effect?\\nIn Norway, the policy rate has never been lower than half a percent. In other countries, policy rates have been as low as minus 0.75 percent.\\nNegative policy rates in other countries have on the whole passed through to money market rates. This reflects that cash is a costly alternative to electronic money for participants in these markets.\\nChart: IBOR rates in countries with negative policy rates\\nThe pass-through to ordinary bank rates is slower. Households and small enterprises can at relatively moderate cost avoid negative deposit rates by withdrawing cash. If banks offer these groups of customers below-zero deposit rates, the banks risk losing an important part of their funding. If deposit rates do not follow policy rates into negative territory, the pass-through to banks' funding costs will gradually weaken, which will in turn dampen or eliminate the decrease in banks' lending rates.4\\nIn order to strengthen the pass-through to long-term market rates, a number of central banks have elected to provide clearer signals about future policy rates, known as forward guidance, in a situation where policy rates are approaching a lower bound and the economic recovery is still sluggish. Some central banks have linked their signals about future policy rates to specific economic indicators or a specific horizon.\\nIn Norway, signals about future policy rates have long been part of the ordinary conduct of monetary policy. Since 2005, our monetary policy reports have included the Bank's own forecasts for the policy rate three to four years ahead. The policy rate path is the Bank's best estimate and not a promise. We have had positive experience with this instrument.\\nAsset purchases\\nOver the past decade, a number of central banks have also begun to use a new instrument of monetary policy: the central bank balance sheet. Balance sheet measures can be roughly divided into two categories: purchases of long-term bonds and long-term extraordinary loans for banks. The objective of this balance sheet policy has been to further reduce the cost of long-term loans.\\nThe measure that has attracted most attention is central banks' government bond purchases, frequently referred to as quantitative easing, or QE. The purchases pull up prices and reduce yields on these bonds. To the extent that the sellers of the bonds shift their demand towards other riskier securities, the yields on these securities could also fall. Central banks' government bond purchases can also function as a signal that policy rates will remain low.\\nStudies suggest that this policy has had an appreciable effect on interest rates and financial prices.5 The alternative monetary policy instruments have most probably also stimulated economic activity, pushed up inflation expectations and underpinned bank lending.6 However, it is difficult to estimate the strength and persistence of these effects more precisely. The choice of method and assumptions affect the results, and estimates diverge widely.\\nA range of studies point out that unconventional monetary policy instruments are most effective in the context of market imbalances and when risk premiums are high. The effect appears to have diminished as interest rates and risk premiums have fallen or as policy rates have approached their lower effective bound.7 In the current environment of very low interest rates in many countries and prospects for slower growth, this gives cause for concern. After ten years of low interest rates, a number of countries may now be caught in what could be described as a liquidity trap. Then, monetary policy is no longer able to stabilise the economy. Other measures are needed. In a number of countries, arguments are being made for the use of fiscal policy measures.\\nThe discussion about the use of unconventional monetary policy also circles around the dividing lines between monetary and fiscal policy.\\nFirst, I would like to call your attention to a possible misunderstanding. Although it is true that quantitative easing involves the creation of new money by central banks to pay for their bond purchases, this does not mean that the central bank prints money to fund public finances. Under quantitative easing, the public sector in its widest sense, including the central bank, purchases one form of debt - government bonds - and replaces it with another - central bank reserves. Quantitative easing affects the economy via lower long-term interest rates.    \\nSome people nevertheless point out that central bank government bond purchases can seem \"quasi-fiscal\".8 Central bank purchases of government bonds in the secondary market can give government authorities an incentive to issue more government debt. The central bank could thus, indirectly, be in the position of contributing to funding government spending. This could blur the distinction between monetary and fiscal policy.\\nA provision that clearly prohibits Norges Bank from extending credit directly to the government is included in Norway's central bank act with the express purpose of safeguarding this distinction. However, this provision does not prohibit Norges Bank from purchasing government bonds in the secondary market.\\nNevertheless, there is much to suggest that the purchase of government bonds is not an option as a policy instrument for Norges Bank. There a number of reasons for this.\\nAs I mentioned previously, floating-rate loans dominate the Norwegian credit market. Unlike other countries, the level of long-term interest rates in itself has little effect on credit demand in Norway. If government bond purchases do not affect future short-term interest rate expectations either, the effect on Norway's wider economy will be limited. Studies in other countries do not provide an unequivocal answer as to whether the bond purchases have had the strongest impact through a fall in the expected policy rate or through lower term premiums on long-term government bonds.\\nWe have seen in earlier periods that fluctuations in Norwegian government bond yields do not necessarily influence other interest rates. There were signs of strong demand for Norwegian government bonds during the euro crisis between 2011 and 2012. Government bond yields fell fairly sharply in this period, primarily as a result of lower term premiums, but did not feed through to any great extent to the interest rates that are important for banks' funding costs.\\nChart: Yields on government bonds, swaps and covered bonds\\nOther countries' government bond yields play an important role as a reference for other interest rates, which is not the case for Norway. Relative to GDP, the government bond market is much smaller and less liquid than in many other countries, with a large proportion of foreign owners.\\nIf Norges Bank had conducted an asset purchase programme in Norway, it is unlikely that foreign investors would have considered other Norwegian securities. Many investors would probably have moved the money from the sale out of Norway. This could have stimulated the economy through a weaker krone exchange rate, but what the extent of the exchange rate reaction would be is highly uncertain.\\nThe introduction of a government bond purchase programme in Norway could also lead to market disruptions. This cost must be taken into account. A further reduction in the number of outstanding bonds would reduce liquidity in a market that is already small. Instead, Norway's economy requires other solutions.\\nForeign central banks have also provided extraordinary loans to banks and purchased bonds backed by residential mortgages (covered bonds). We associate such instruments with financial market turbulence. In periods of considerable turbulence and high financial market risk premiums, these instruments can reduce banks' funding costs and increase the predictability of banks' funding. The purpose is to prevent an abrupt fall in credit growth from increasing the risk of a severe economic downturn or having an adverse impact on an already weak economy.\\nIn Norway, the government used covered bonds in a swap arrangement that was in operation between November 2008 and October 2009.9 The swap arrangement was a response to banks' substantially weaker access to long-term funding after the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. The arrangement dampened the effect of high risk premiums in the market and complemented the policy rate cuts that were made in the same period.\\nExtraordinary loans for banks\\nProviding longer-term loans on extraordinary terms was an instrument commonly used by many central banks at the start of the financial crisis. In the euro area, this instrument remained in use after the turbulence had subsided in the form of the so-called TLTRO programmes. The terms of the loans are intended to spur banks to maintain or increase growth in lending to households and enterprises.\\nNorges Bank regularly lends to banks, but only in the short term in order to regulate liquidity in the banking system. In normal times, when markets are functioning normally, it is not our job to compete with the private investors that fund banks. However, if banks' funding markets cease to function, as in 2008, the situation is different.\\nIn Norway, central bank loans on extraordinary terms are more likely to be provided in order to bring down short-term money market rates, known as Nibor rates, closer to the policy rate. This could be considered in a situation where the policy rate is near its lower bound while short-term market rates are substantially higher. Whether the measure would be the right option or not depends on the reason for the high risk premium. The measure could have a rapid effect. Short-term money market rates play an important role for Norwegian banks' funding costs. A reduction in risk premiums will therefore have an impact on much of banks' outstanding debt and not just on new loans.\\nForeign exchange market measures\\nA few words on the exchange rate. For small open economies like Norway, the exchange rate is an important transmission channel for monetary policy. Changes in the exchange rate influence both inflation and the real economy via firms' competitiveness.\\nForeign exchange interventions have been used, and continue to be used, by many central banks worldwide. Inflation-targeting countries use interventions less, and often not at all. Norges Bank has not intervened to influence the exchange rate since 1999. The policy rate is the primary instrument of monetary policy and the exchange rate is free floating. In recent years, the exchange rate has been a valuable shock absorber for the economy.\\nChart. Exchange rate floors for Switzerland and the Czech Republic\\nSome inflation-targeting countries have intervened directly in foreign exchange markets over the past decade. The Swiss and Czech central banks have kept their exchange rates weaker than a given level against the euro. The purpose of the measures has been to prevent their own currencies from appreciating in order to prevent inflation from falling and keep it closer to the inflation target than would otherwise have been the case.\\nForeign exchange market measures can be effective if there is a risk that confidence in the nominal anchor is being undermined by prospects for low inflation and it is not appropriate to lower the policy rate further. However, this type of measure also exposes the central bank's equity to greater risk. In Norway, foreign exchange market intervention is not applicable in a normal situation.\\nDivision of responsibilities and level of ambition for economic policy\\nLet me draw together the strands of my discussion so far. The introduction of the inflation target in 2001 laid the premises for today's division of responsibilities in the conduct of Norway's economic policy. Monetary policy pursues the objective of low and stable inflation and is the first line of defence in stabilising the economy. Fiscal policy contributes to stability within the framework of the fiscal rule. This framework has served us well for almost 20 years.\\nThe Norwegian economy is currently performing well, while there are some dark clouds on the international horizon. Hopefully, we are only seeing a period of slower growth, but a severe downturn cannot be ruled out. If such a downturn were to occur with policy rates as low as they are now, monetary policy space for major economies would be very limited.\\nChart: Central bank balance sheets\\nPolicy rates are still negative for several of our trading partners, more than a decade after the financial crisis. The extraordinary measures that have been applied have also led to a substantial expansion of central bank balance sheets, and in a number of countries they are still expanding. In Sweden and Japan, the asset purchase programmes have not yet been brought to an end, and the European Central Bank has recently announced that its asset purchase programme will be restarted  (also note that Japan has to have a separate graph in this chart). Unconventional instruments appear to have become a part of the ordinary central bank toolkit.\\nWe have more policy room for manoeuvre in Norway as the policy rate has risen slightly. In the event of a severe downturn, we would lower the policy rate. In principle, other countries' experience shows that the impact of a lower policy rate does not stop at the zero lower bound, even though the scope for rates below zero is limited. But in Norway it is difficult to envisage negative rates over a long period or monetary policy being stretched even further through unconventional measures. Even though such measures would probably have some effect here in Norway, the potential gains must be weighed against the costs. Norway also has fiscal room for manoeuvre.\\nAs I have mentioned, there is probably less to gain from lower long-term rates in Norway than in countries that have used unconventional instruments to reduce rates. And the effects of such instruments are now also being called into question internationally.\\nThe costs are particularly related to financial stability. Persistently low interest rates can induce investors to take on greater risk in the search for yield, bidding up the price of risky investments and pushing down yields to the level of risk-free interest rates. Prices for securities and other assets can be pushed up higher than future income and risk would suggest. High debt ratios create vulnerabilities, increasing the risk of new crises and future losses. Persistently lower interest rates can also hamper necessary structural changes and reduce the economy's growth capacity. Debt becomes easy to service, even for unprofitable enterprises. Projects that generate low returns can be debt-financed.\\nChart: Fiscal impulses\\nThe strategy pursued by other countries of stretching the limits of monetary policy must be viewed in the light of monetary policy being practically the only instrument applied. Fiscal policy has made a scant contribution or pulled in the opposite direction. There are probably a number of reasons why this is the case. For some countries with high government debt, the risk of rising interest expenses restricted fiscal room for manoeuvre. At the same time, fiscal policy is managed at national government level. The impact of crises differs across countries, and it is often not the countries with the most room for manoeuvre that are the hardest hit. As a result, the motivation to use the fiscal policy tool is also weaker in these countries.\\nIn Norway, we have room for manoeuvre in fiscal policy and a tradition of using it in our management of the business cycle. If we were to face a situation with a very low policy rate and prospects of persistently low resource utilisation, it would be natural for fiscal policy to play a greater role than at an early stage. Consequently, there is less need to steer monetary policy into uncharted waters and risk negative side effects.\\nLet me emphasise that there is a difference between crisis measures and the use of instruments in more normal business cycles. When market confidence breaks down, as in 2008, the potential of monetary policy must be exploited. In such a situation, it may also be necessary to delve deeper into the monetary policy toolkit.\\nNorges Bank supplied liquidity to banks during the first phase of the financial crisis in the form of loans, as did other central banks. Some of the loans were offered at longer maturities than normal. Norges Bank also managed a swap arrangement on behalf of the government, with the aim of giving banks cheaper and more predictable funding. Combined with a low policy rate and an expansionary fiscal policy, these measures prevented a deep downturn in the Norwegian economy.\\nFiscal policy directly affects total demand in the economy. Fiscal policy can be very effective when the economy is characterised by high unemployment and very low interest rates alone cannot provide sufficient stimulus. The side effects of fiscal policy via asset prices are also less severe.\\nThere are good reasons why monetary policy is the first line of defence in managing the business cycle in normal times. The policy rate can react rapidly, both when the economy is exposed to shocks and when the monetary policy impulse needs to be reversed. Fiscal stimulus measures take longer to implement and can be more challenging to reverse.\\nA related issue is the ambition level we should set for our inflation targeting. Our statutory responsibility is to deliver low and stable inflation. According to the Regulation on Monetary Policy, our target is annual consumer price inflation of close to 2 percent over time. But monetary policy is also expected to contribute to high and stable output and employment and to counteracting the build-up of financial imbalances. Inflation targeting should be forward-looking and flexible. In some situations, a longer horizon than usual is appropriate for returning inflation to the target after a deviation. This may lead to a better overall result. In the wake of the fall in oil prices in 2014, the policy rate was lowered, but we stopped at 0.5 percent. The objective of financial stability was given weight.\\nThe scope for flexibility in inflation targeting depends on how well inflation expectations are anchored at the target. Norges Bank's experience, based on close to 20 years of inflation targeting, suggests that a small open economy must expect inflation to deviate fairly widely from the target at times, rising above target or falling below. But at the same time, inflation has remained within a range around the target where deviations from the target cannot be said to have entailed material economic costs. This has provided leeway to give weight to other considerations in the Bank's monetary policy trade-offs. Other countries have come to other conclusions and have chosen to stretch the limits of monetary policy further to bring inflation back to target.\\nIf we some time in the future were to experience falling demand and a risk of deflation, we will use the instruments at our disposal to address this situation. Our job will be less difficult if fiscal policy also contributes. The primary responsibility of monetary policy, however, is to provide the economy with a nominal anchor, quantified by the inflation target assigned to Norges Bank. Our instruments will always be geared towards this objective.\\n  References\\nBorio, C. and A. Zabai (2016) \"Unconventional monetary policies: a re-appraisal\".

        "content": "As prepared for delivery.\\nIt is a great pleasure to be here today to open Banco de Portugal's 2019 Conference on Financial Stability. \\nOn behalf of Banco de Portugal and, in particular, of the organising team, I would like to welcome you all!\\nAlthough these introductory remarks have to be brief, I would like to set the stage for today's discussions by highlighting what I believe to be the critical premises for a Central Bank's mandate on financial stability and by identifying some of the risks we are faced with today.\\nAs recently noted by ECB's President, Mario Draghi, \"[i]t was only after the crisis that there was widespread recognition of the importance of the macro dimension of financial stability.\"1\\nCentral Banks play a crucial role in ensuring economic and financial stability. They conduct monetary policy to achieve low and stable inflation and, as recognised by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), \"are well placed to conduct macroprudential policy because they have the capacity to analyse systemic risk.\"2\\nThe global financial crisis provided evidence of the need to contain risks to the financial system as a whole through dedicated financial policies. \\nAgainst this background, many central banks that also have a mandate to promote financial stability have upgraded their financial stability functions, including by establishing macroprudential policy frameworks.3 But to work effectively, macroprudential policy needs a strong institutional foundation. \\nAs advised by the IMF, \"[t]he institutional setup should be strong enough to counter opposition from the financial industry and political pressures and to establish the legitimacy and accountability of macroprudential policy. It needs to ensure that policymakers are given clear objectives and the necessary legal powers, and to foster cooperation on the part of other supervisory and regulatory agencies.\"4\\nMoreover, we also need to keep in mind that safeguarding financial stability does not aim at preventing bank failures in themselves. \\nWhereas the main focus of microprudential supervision is to safeguard individual financial institutions from idiosyncratic risks and prevent them from taking too much risk, macroprudential supervision takes into account the interactions among individual financial institutions, as well as the feedback loops of the financial sector with the real economy.5\\nAs recognised by the Single Supervisory Mechanism, \"[b]anks can and should exit the market if they are managed in a risky and unsound manner, or if they are structurally incapable of maintaining their competitiveness based on a sound business model.\"6\\nIn such cases, the authority entrusted with ensuring financial stability should be equipped with the necessary instruments to safeguard confidence and ensure the financing of the economy is not disrupted.\\nPost-global financial crisis, this has been achieved through the establishment of resolution frameworks whereby the usage of public funds is minimised. New powers and tools have been created and entrusted - in many cases to Central Banks - to ensure that critical operations of banks can continue and value is preserved while losses are mostly absorbed by shareholders and creditors with the aim of preserving financial stability.\\nNew institutions have also been created. The creation of the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), nine years ago, was a milestone in this respect.\\nIn sum, \\nFirst, financial stability is inherent to the mandate of central banks;\\nSecond, microprudential supervision is essential but not sufficient to safeguard financial stability. Macroprudential supervision is also needed and it should be entrusted to the entities that are better placed to assess systemic risks, i.e., the central banks;\\nThird, in order to conduct macroprudential supervision and succeed in their mandate central banks need adequate instruments;\\nFourth, financial stability is not about preventing bank failures, it is about safeguarding depositors' confidence and preserving the regular financing of the economy. Adequate resolution and liquidation frameworks, including access to public funds, are thus an indispensable part of the crisis management toolkit. \\nIt should also be noted that the low interest rate environment of recent years may require a more active stance of the macroprudential authorities as it contributed to a build-up of vulnerabilities and risks to financial stability.\\nLet me now turn briefly to today's programme. Since its inception, macroprudential policy has gradually been implemented in Europe against a unique financial and economic background, establishing itself as an autonomous economic policy area while interacting with other policy domains. \\nThis is a topic that will be addressed at this conference, in particular at the roundtable where the interaction between macroprudential and microprudential policies will be dealt with. \\nThis environment, characterised by crisis legacies, led, unsurprisingly, some macroprudential policy authorities to postpone the use of macroprudential instruments included in the EU legislation, or to gradually phase them in over time.\\nThese decisions were taken against a regulatory framework that assigns some discretion to macroprudential authorities allowing them to tailor their action to the specificities of each country. \\nThe discretion exercised by macroprudential authorities, together with the different risk environments and institutional setups for macroprudential policy across countries, have led, as expected, to some heterogeneity in the action taken by these authorities. \\nThese differences are reflected not only on the type of instruments used, but also on the methodologies, calibration and speed at which measures were implemented. But this is precisely one of the positive features of the macroprudential policy: the adoption of measures according to specific national circumstances.\\nBased on information gathered by the ESRB, macroprudential measures implemented in the EU rose from 37 in 2014 to 58 in 2018. These data reflect the increasing intervention of macroprudential authorities across Europe - where Portugal is also included - over the past five years, setting the stage for the first session of today's conference. \\nIn this session we will have the opportunity to discuss - benefiting from this increasing experience - the challenges in assessing the effects of macroprudential policy, not only on the financial system and on economic activity, but also on how it interacts with other policy fields.\\nAnother interesting conclusion that can be drawn from ESRB data is that macroprudential authorities have often preferred to use instruments targeted at credit standards, commonly known as borrower-based measures, namely to address the systemic risk arising from developments in the residential real estate market. \\nAs we all know this risk has increased in the majority of the European countries, specifically in some of the bigger cities, as also recently stressed by the ESRB. \\nGiven the well-established interaction between real estate market and the banking sector, and well-known underlying systemic risk, we dedicate a whole session of this conference to the systemic importance of housing and mortgage markets and the transmission channels of related macroprudential instruments. In view of the political dimension of some of these instruments, something we all need to discuss is how best they should be designed and communicated to inform public debate.\\nFinally, in the afternoon we will also focus on how the high levels of debt of non-financial corporations may impair economic activity and financial stability. This is a topic that definitely gets to the heart of some European countries given the underlying link with the significant increase in non-performing loans during and in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. \\nLet me conclude. \\nMacroprudential authorities have been increasingly active in promoting financial stability, despite facing multiple challenges throughout their relatively short existence. \\nHowever, the nature of these challenges has changed in tandem with the upturn in economic activity, the strengthening of financial systems, the action taken by other policymakers and the signs of a reversal in the financial cycle, the intensity of which is also conditional on each country's specific situation \\nHeterogeneity between countries remains and is likely to continue in the future. That is why macroprudential policy is foremost country specific. But this does not mean that we have nothing to learn from each other. It is precisely the opposite, as today's conference programme will show. \\nI would like to thank you all again for taking the time to join us here today. Many thanks in particular to our speakers and session chairs. I wish everyone a very pleasant and productive day, with insightful discussions both on and off the podium. \\n1 Draghi, M.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank our partners from De La Rue, a company having extensive knowledge and expertise on the subject matter, for joining us in this endeavour. I am equally delighted that our local stakeholders have responded positively to be part of this knowledge sharing experience.\\nCurrency counterfeiting is a long-standing and global phenomenon, and Seychelles has also recorded its share of reports on the circulation of forged banknotes over the years.\\nAs the sole authority that issues banknotes in Seychelles, the Central Bank has taken steps to prevent counterfeiting and maintain public confidence in our local currency. As recently as 2016, we issued a new family of banknotes into circulation, embedded with new and improved security features.\\nNevertheless, we are mindful that there is a need to be more vigilant and proactive, as counterfeiters are also keeping pace with new technologies for their criminal activities. It is for this reason that I commend the initiative of the\\nBanking Services Division, through its Currency function, for putting together this multi-stakeholder seminar to stimulate discussion and engagement on this important subject. The issue of counterfeiting should be a matter of concern not only for us as the currency issuing agent, but also for the commercial banks, other financial institutions, as well as other partners, such as the law enforcement and regulatory authorities, and the public at large.\\nThe ability for criminals to gain access to equipment that can produce counterfeit banknotes - including the ability to replicate the security features, as well as difficulties relating to investigation of counterfeiting activities, are but some of the challenges with which we are currently faced. I am hopeful that the seminar will not only highlight the extent of the counterfeiting problem globally and in Seychelles, but also create a platform for the sharing of ideas and expertise on how to tackle such challenges.\\nWhile it is important to keep abreast of developments with regards to enhancing the security features of banknotes and attempts by criminals to forge currencies, it is equally essential that we enhance public awareness and education.\\nFrom this workshop, let us individually and collectively find ways to relay the message to the population. Each and every individual can play a role in maintaining confidence in our currency by being encouraged to 'know our money'. Having a population that is knowledgeable and familiar with the security features of genuine banknotes can surely contribute towards efforts to prevent the introduction of fake money into our financial system, as well as minimising economic losses.\\nOn this note, I wish you all a fruitful seminar and look forward to the outcomes on how we can move forward and join the global efforts to combat counterfeiting and uphold domestic financial system integrity.\\nThank you."

        "content": "Good morning. I am happy to be here in Kansas City for the 13th of 14 Fed Listens events. I look forward to hearing the perspectives of the community and business leaders participating today.\\nThe Reserve Banks and the Board have been holding Fed Listens events around the country as part of a comprehensive and public review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications practices. Almost all of the Fed Listens meetings, like this one, have been open to the press and live-streamed on the internet. Both the breadth and transparency of the review are unprecedented for us.\\nOne reason we are conducting this review is that it is always a good practice for any organization to occasionally take a step back and ask if it could be doing its job more effectively. But we must pose that question not just to ourselves. Because Congress has granted the Federal Reserve significant protections from short-term political pressures, we have an obligation to clearly explain what we are doing and why. And we have an obligation to actively engage the people we serve so that they and their elected representatives can hold us accountable. We have invited you here because we want to better understand how monetary policy affects your lives and the lives of the people your organizations represent. We want to hear your perspective on maximum employment and price stability-the monetary policy goals Congress has assigned us.\\nNow is a good time to conduct the review. Unemployment is at a half-century low, and inflation is running close to, but a bit below, our 2 percent objective. While not everyone fully shares economic opportunities and the economy faces some risks, overall, it is-as I like to say-in a good place. Our job is to keep it there as long as possible. While we believe our strategy and tools have been and remain effective, the U.S. economy, like other advanced economies around the world, is facing some longer-term challenges-from low growth, low inflation, and low interest rates. While slow growth is obviously not good, you may be asking, \"What's wrong with low inflation and low interest rates?\" Low can be good, but when inflation-and, consequently, interest rates-are too low, the Fed and other central banks have less room to cut rates to support the economy during downturns.\\nSo, in this review, we are examining strategies that might better allow us to symmetrically and sustainably achieve 2 percent inflation. Doing so would help prevent inflation expectations among consumers, businesses, and investors from slipping too low, as they appear to have done in several advanced economies. More-firmly anchored expectations, in a virtuous circle, would help keep actual inflation around our target, thus preserving our ability to change interest rates as appropriate to meet our mandate. We are also looking at whether our existing monetary policy tools will be adequate when the next downturn comes. Finally, we are asking whether our communications practices can be improved to better support the effectiveness of our policy.\\nAfter today, we have one Fed Listens session remaining, later this month in Chicago. At the July meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, my colleagues and I began discussing what we have learned so far from the Fed Listens events. We continued that discussion at our September meeting and have a lot left to do. We plan to publicly report our conclusions during the first half of next year.\\nOne clear takeaway of the sessions so far is the importance of sustaining this historically strong job market. People from low- and moderate-income communities tell us that this long recovery, now in its 11th year, is benefiting them and their neighbors to a degree that has not been felt for many years. Employers are partnering with community colleges and nonprofit organizations to offer training. And people who have struggled to stay in the workforce in the past are getting new opportunities.\\nOnce again, I'm happy to be here. Now it is your turn to speak. We're listening."

Congress passed, and the President approved, a game-changing law that liberalizes rice importation.\\nAs such, after peaking at 6.7 percent in September 2018, inflation continued its downward trend, settling at 0.9 percent in September, the lowest in over three years. \\nBased on these developments, BSP estimates that inflation will settle at 2.5 percent this year, and 2.9 percent in 2020 and 2021, well within the official target of 2.0 to 4.0 percent.\\nThird-party institutions agree that inflation will be within target range up to 2021.\\nWith this benign policy environment, the BSP, so far this year has been able to:\\n1)    Cut the key policy rate by a total of 75 basis points and\\n2)    Cut the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) by a total of 300 basis points, 100 basis points of which will be effective at the start of November\\nThe favorable growth and inflation dynamics also helped boost business confidence and investments in the country. This is evident in part by the increase in importation of capital and intermediate goods to support an expanding economy.\\nThe increase in imports has led to a manageable deficit in the current account (CA). In fact, the current account deficit is financeable, with robust foreign exchange inflows in the capital and financial account expected to keep the overall balance of payments (BOP) in surplus this year.\\nThe country's balance of payments position is driven primarily by steady inflows of business process outsourcing (BPO) revenues, overseas Filipinos' cash remittances, and tourism receipts.\\nCombined, these three items recorded an amount equivalent to 17.2 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) in 2018.\\nAnother solid source of foreign exchange is foreign direct investments (FDIs), which amounted to about US$10 billion both in 2017 and 2018. In 2010 and earlier years, FDIs hovered at only less than US$2 billion. Improvements in the macroeconomic and business climate are credited for the rise in FDIs.\\nLooking ahead, we expect FDIs to remain robust, as shown by hefty amounts of investment pledges approved by the country's investment promotion agencies (IPAs). \\nIn the first half of this year, foreign investment applications approved by the IPAs amounted to P95.6 billion, more than twice the P45.2 billion recorded in the same period last year.\\nThe economy also enjoys sufficient buffers against external headwinds. Its gross international reserves (GIR) are high while external debt burden is low. \\nAs of end-September, the GIR amounted to US$86.2 billion. This is enough to cover 7.5 months' worth of imports of goods and payments for services and primary income. The received doctrine is that 3 months worth of imports is enough.\\nThe country's external debt is manageable. It is a mere 23.8 percent of GDP as of end-June 2019. Manageability of external debt has improved significantly over the years, with the amount recorded at nearly 60 percent of GDP in 2005.\\nThe country's banking system remains sound and stable. \\nWith healthy indicators, including more-than-adequate capitalization and low exposure to bad debts, banks are able to help fund the growing investment requirements in the economy.\\nCredit growth, which has settled in the double-digit territory over the last few years, has benefited the productive sectors of the economy. This bodes well for sustained growth.  \\nRobust lending growth has consistently come along maintenance of good quality of loans, reflecting observance of prudent lending standards.\\nWe expect lending growth to continue, especially with the BSP's intention to continue slashing the reserve requirement ratio (RRR). \\nShould the inflation outlook continue to improve, we will further cut the RRR until it reaches single digit by the end of my term in 2023.\\nAs you know, we have room and reason to reduce the RRR as it is currently the highest among select peer countries. RRR is a friction cost, and lowering it is consistent with the aim of further enhancing financial intermediation.\\nIn the past, the high RRR had served as an important tool to mop up excess liquidity. But now that the BSP, under its amended charter, has the mandate to issue its own debt securities, we can rely less on the RRR for liquidity management. \\nWith lower RRR, the banking sector can then lend more support to the economy's growth prospects.\\nIt is also important to note that economic growth in the Philippines is happening not only in the National Capital Region (NCR) but throughout the country.\\nIn fact, growth rates of other regions are outpacing that of the NCR. Growth in the regions is expected to remain robust, driven in part by infrastructure development across regions. \\nThis pattern of growth is consistent with the aim to make economic growth more inclusive.\\nNevertheless, the BSP will continue to adopt measures that will improve the regulatory and operational environment so that banks will be able to support robust and inclusive economic growth. \\nThe financial sector can help spur a more inclusive growth through financial inclusion. We have achieved milestones on financial inclusion as far as regulations are concerned. In fact, the Philippines is recognized as having one of the best regulatory environments in the world for financial inclusion.\\nHowever, many municipalities still do not have banks operating in their areas. A big part of the country's adult population still do not use formal channels to save or borrow money.\\nTo enhance financial inclusion, the BSP has implemented several initiatives and are further strengthening its efforts. \\nFor instance, we have issued regulations allowing other entities to serve as cash agents or to perform financial services on behalf of banks, as well as regulations that make it easier for people to open bank accounts. \\nThe BSP also spearheads the Credit Surety Fund (CSF) program, wherein pooled funds from various institutions - such as state-owned banks, local governments, and cooperatives - serve as collateral for loans applied for by micro entrepreneurs.\\nWe have also implemented the National Retail Payment System (NRPS), which is a framework for interoperable, secure, efficient, and affordable fund transfers.\\nOur regulatory environment also enables the promotion of financial technology (fintech). In a country like the Philippines where mobile phone penetration is high, it is prudent for financial regulators to recognize the potential of fintech to hasten financial inclusion.\\nIn fulfillment of the NRPS, two interoperable payment systems have been launched-InstaPay for low-value fund transfers credited real time, and the PESONet for bigger-value fund transfers credited within the same banking day. \\nThese payment systems allow funds to be transferred electronically from one financial institution to another. Most of the big banks are already participating in PESONet and InstaPay. Soon, we expect more banks, particularly the smaller ones, to participate and further boost electronic payments.\\nWe expect e-payments to hit 20 percent of total financial transactions in the country by next year.\\nWe are also keen on hitting the targets of reducing the number of unbanked municipalities from about a third a few years back to only 20 percent by the end of next year, and to have the estimated 20 million unbanked or under-served Filipinos access the formal financial system also by the end of next year. \\nWe can imagine the Philippines becoming a cash-light economy, with e-payments accounting for at least half of total financial transactions in five years.\\nThe law amending the BSP charter was signed into law last February. With it, the BSP's ability to fulfill its mandates of price and financial stability is enhanced.\\nSome highlights of the law include\\n(1)    increase in capitalization;\\n(2)    authority to issue our own debt instruments;\\n(3)    wider supervision to include not only banks but also money service institutions, credit granting businesses, and payment system operators;\\n(4)    authority to prescribe minimum risk-based capital adequacy ratios; and\\n(5)    protection of concerned BSP personnel against lawsuits arising from the conduct of the BSP's financial regulation duties.\\nOther important laws concerning the BSP have also been enacted recently, including\\n(1)    Islamic Banking law, which provides the framework for regulation and development of Islamic banking in the country;\\n(2)    Gold law, which exempts from taxes the sale of gold from small-scale mining to the BSP;\\n(3)    the National Payment Systems Act, which formally recognizes the BSP as supervisor of the country's payments and settlements system;\\n(4)    Personal Property Securities Act, which allows use of other assets besides real properties to serve as collateral for loans to boost micro lending;\\n(5)    Philippine ID system, which will ensure all Filipinos have proper identification, thus allowing banks to comply with know-your-customer (KYC) rules when they offer financial services to the poor; and\\n(6)    Anti-hacking law, which imposes stiffer penalties on hacking, thus better protecting the financial services industry and their customers from IT-related fraud.\\nWith my appointment as BSP Governor coming shortly before and after the enactment of these new laws, I consider it my personal mission to oversee the prompt and effective implementation of these game-changing reforms.\\nWe are not stopping here. More legislative reforms are in the pipeline, and we are keen to see them being implemented soon. These include\\n(1)    amendments to bank secrecy laws, which will support efforts versus money laundering and tax evasion;\\n(2)    amendments to the Agri-Agra law, which will relax provisions of mandated lending to the agriculture sector;\\n(3)    Financial Consumer Protection bill, which seeks to require financial institutions to have mechanisms in place to protect financial consumers; and\\n(4)    amendments to the Warehouse receipts law, which seeks to modernize the warehouse receipts system to better account for assets that can serve as collateral for loans.\\nBesides the legislative agenda, we are also pushing for a wide range of other reforms, including in the areas of risk governance, fintech, integrity of financial system and safeguarding of public interest; and capital market development.\\nThe newly enacted laws and those in the pipeline are a continuation of the Philippines' long history of structural reforms, which have strengthened the country's macroeconomic environment over the years.\\nRest assured that the BSP will be one with the government in continuing the reform agenda to push the Philippines to its next stage of development.\\nAt the moment, the Philippines enjoys investment grade credit ratings and is on the cusp of becoming an upper middle income economy.\\nWith the reform momentum, we expect the Philippines to become an A-rated economy in the next two years or so, and to become a high income economy by 2040.\\nIn closing, allow me to give the following take-away points: \\nFirst, the Philippines will remain among the fastest growing economies in the region and the world; \\nSecond, amid external headwinds, sustained growth will be supported by healthy external payments position and strong domestic demand;  \\nThird, robust, sustainable, and more inclusive economic growth will be supported both by \"soft\" or policy reforms and \"hard\" or physical infrastructure reforms; and\\nFourth, the reform momentum will push the Philippines to its next stage of development where it enjoys Single A credit ratings in the next two years or so, and where it becomes a high-income economy in two decades. \\nAmid this favorable backdrop, we invite everyone to seize the growth opportunities that this economy offers.  \\nThank you very much and mabuhay!"

        "content": "The most profound mystery is that of human being. Human being, man and woman.\\nWomen are accused of impractical and dangerous sentimentality, but can we say that men are inherently realistic? Immortal genes and the alternation of matriarchy and patriarchy - what does it all prove? The relativity of superiority and differences.\\nA man can live without a woman, but without women, there is no future.\\nWomen are still kept outside of certain areas and roles in society. This is the mirror of gender essentialism which is often a tool of ostracism. Women are gaining ground in central banking and of this process I can speak confidently only from my own experience.\\nThere are women who have been loved three times in their life. First by their mothers, who delivered them to this world, then by their husbands whom they married, and lastly by the children they delivered. The same is true of men. And love is that sacred root of plants that exude strength and love - for everything they do, for everyone around them and for anything they may face.\\nAll who are born yearning to be loved, and raised with a lack of love, have a more difficult time succeeding in life, I think, I believe - because I can only speak with certainty about my own experience.\\nI had the support of others but not because I was a woman, rather because I desired knowledge, I was open to learning, talking, committed to myself and to others. I didn't seek the company of those who wanted to indulge me, but of those who were able to think and see far ahead, beyond their own pocket and their own lives.  \\nWe should be aware that this world should not be a simple alternation of matriarchy and patriarchy but rather that we should support each other's best characteristics while moving towards the holiest of goals.\\nThere are such riddles and challenges ahead of us that require various voices, different experiences and wisdom.\\nWe shouldn't labour under the illusion that all women would give the same response to any particular question.\\nWe should therefore include more women in decision-making, because women are talented and dedicated, and want to do their part. By excluding them, we deprive not only women, but also society of better results and progress. Women are as talented as men. And among them there are differences as much as there are among men.\\nThis means that it's always possible for a group of men to find a woman who shares their views - who also thinks that women are inferior and should be excluded.\\nMy guiding principle in life is the results I achieve.\\nThere are powerful women who stand behind their name, expertise and work; those whose modesty is keeping them in the shadow of the men they work for; but there are also those who claim power from powerful men. The power of each of these categories shows how society treats women, but also how women need to be more supportive of women.\\nJust as I believe that it is wrong not to promote someone only because that person is a woman, I also believe it is equally wrong to give someone a chance only because that person is a woman. I select my associates based on their professional merits and human qualities, not their gender.\\nIn my opinion it is crucial that any position should be held by a professional - with adequate knowledge, experience, character and honesty. I can personally confirm that the National Bank of Serbia, which I'm heading for more than seven years now, does not seek to meet quotas in order to advance women in leading positions. The persons who are currently at the head of our organisational parts are all experts with a good deal of experience. All of them have a sense of responsibility and teamwork. I know that such a balanced and modern approach has yielded a significant contribution to the success which the National Bank of Serbia, as an institution, is recording today in terms of fulfilling its mandate.\\nWith dedicated work we have achieved not only low and stable inflation, but have also anchored inflation expectations of the financial, corporate and household sectors within the target tolerance band for quite some time now. This is a proof of the confidence we have built up since I came to the helm of the National Bank of Serbia.\\nIt is owing to this stability and the continued improvement in the business environment that Serbia is one of the few countries in the region that have kept their GDP growth projections and posted record-high FDI inflows. Interest rates on loans have been lowered, lending activity and banking system stability have increased, the level of non-performing loans is down to the lowest level on record, and banking sector liquidity has increased by RSD 16.5 bn. The result is a better quality of living and the creation of preconditions for sustainable development.\\nWe use the opportunities that are presented to us, and more importantly, we create opportunities. We have transformed Serbia into a stable economy with a good perspective. At the same time, Serbia is making significant progress in terms of gender equality. Allow me to illustrate this with an example. According to a World Bank research \"Women, Business and Law\", in 2019 Serbia shared the high 16th position with Australia and Iceland on a list of 188 countries. This is the best result in the region and a more favourable rating compared to many other EU members. Another indicator of the important results in this remit is the movement in the gender equality index, which we started publishing in 2016 as the first non-EU country to do so.\\nFirst, I believe that gender equality complements the achievements of our civilisation, as well as that it is an imperative for our future.\\nSecond, gender equality is a factor of development which should not be merely spoken of, but to which we must make an active contribution.\\nI believe that this is the case with the National Bank of Serbia. During 135 years of the Bank's history, it often happened that women made up the majority of the Executive Board members, whereby they had a key influence on strategic decision-making. Chronologically, the inclusion of women in central bank governance is dominant in the 21st century. Today women hold the positions of the Governor and Vice-Governors of the National Bank of Serbia and constitute the majority in the Executive Board. This is why I feel entitled to say that gender equality is respected and implemented, but even more importantly, that there is equality and respect for each individual.\\nKnow thyself 2. Nothing in excess 3. Make a pledge and mischief is neigh. The carvings at the entrance to Apollo's temple in Delphi with these three maxims give us a key to successful living, if success is measured by how much we are satisfied with ourselves, as well as how much others are satisfied with us.\\nThese three maxims speak very vividly about the woman and her role in today's society. What do we actually want as persons, what are our accomplishments, what are we prepared to sacrifice in order to achieve the chosen goal and is every sacrifice in the achievement of that goal really needed and justified? Do we know how to remain the masters of our own peace, our happiness, not making too many promises because we have an opportunity to participate in the game?\\nThe essence of these questions are topics whose backbone is the difficulty to balance motherhood and career.\\nWhy is the choice always either/or, black or white, career or motherhood, my way or no way? Balance is a key to success.\\nCareer or motherhood?\\nMotherhood does not necessarily mean family. Family is an obligation, but also a source of support. How did we come to sacrifice family to service activities? Instead of solidarity within the home, family and generations, we now have paid services - service providers who care for our children, as well as for our parents, the elderly. We have lonesome individuals who have lost their bearings and a clear goal in this race for individuality and recognition. Not all relations are those of purchase and sale, not everything can be bought. That is why we need to preserve our humanity, self-respect and the respect of others.\\nBeing a woman is amazing. Being a mother is even more so. I can testify to this with my experience of raising three children, two daughters and a son - who are now grown-up, and good and educated persons, of whom I am proud and whom I respect.\\nBut being a successful woman, a satisfied woman and a mother who shows that it is possible to be both - this is the best way to motivate others."

        "title": "Adnan Zaylani Mohamad Zahid: Leading in a disruptive world - revolutionising Takaful",
        "content": "I am delighted to join all of you today at the 2019 Takaful Rendezvous. This is an important gathering for the finance and business community to exchange ideas on the opportunities and issues facing the global takaful industry. Our backdrop today is of an economy and environment that has seen remarkable changes and challenges that emerge in just a short period of time. While we have thought the financial crises of recent times were safely behind us, the global and domestic economy has been beset with an escalating trade war that has rippled far. This has affected the trade and investment climate worldwide and could bring about large downside risks. Malaysia's economy will not be spared from this fallout.\\nAt the same time, we have a growing sense of urgency to deal with environmental challenges. Globally, the focus is shifting towards climate change and sustainability. Closer to home, we have just experienced an episode of the country's now, alarmingly, annual haze seasonality. Undoubtedly, each one of us can feel the impact and risks from environmental degradation on the quality of our daily lives. It will not be long from the time when we can clearly see its negative impact to the economy and financial stability. On a positive note, technology has transformed virtually every aspect of our lives - the way we interact with each other, consume our needs, follow the news, and navigate our movements. By 2018, more than half of the global population have become internet users. Here in Malaysia, almost 90% of Malaysians are internet users, and more than half of these users conduct banking and financial activities online. Digitisation and technology adaptation is already making significant inroads in providing new solutions going forward and has become a key strategy for us to enhance financial inclusion and also protection. While this means financial institutions now have greater avenues to reach consumers, it also entails greater exposure to emerging vulnerabilities and risks such as cyber and technology risks. This needs to be properly managed, otherwise it can potentially trigger grave systemic consequences.\\nIn addition, there are also the gradual and structural changes that we cannot ignore. Over the last 20 years, the global population has more than doubled to reach 7.5 billion. This has posed significant challenges for policy makers and governments to appropriately allocate capital and finite resources. Every country including Malaysia is experiencing ageing population growth and will be affected by demographic changes either today or in future years. Declining share of working-age population and higher number of old-age dependents will strain the healthcare systems and place an upward pressure on costs of pension schemes. The design of financial protection has to evolve and, for many underserved segments, financial protection has become even more pressing. Islamic finance and takaful should therefore embrace its transformative role, responding to these evolving needs, rather than merely reacting to past and existing demand. It is thus imperative for takaful industry to be agile and adapt to these changes.\\nIn my remarks today, I will outline three dimensions that offer significant opportunities for the transformative role of takaful:\\nFirst, takaful can be a key enabler for the Muslim economy;\\nSecond, it can be a solution of choice for Malaysians; and\\nThird, it can also be a game-changer in empowering financial resilience.\\nTakaful as a key enabler for the Muslim economy\\nFor hundreds of years, merchants and traders have relied on arrangements based on mutual assistance to protect each other against the perils of sea travels, damage to property and other forms of misfortunes. Marine protection schemes, similar to the schemes offered in Edward Lloyd's coffee shop more than 330 years ago, can be traced back to the Islamic civilisation of the Ottoman Empire. One could argue that such protection arrangements were part of the ecosystem that made such empires the marine superpowers of their times. Fast forward to modern times, households and businesses continue to experience various risk events that could impact their lives, financial capabilities and assets. From nature-driven risks to man-made risks, these risks will directly impact those we protect and cover in increasingly significant ways.\\nThe Muslim economy, in particular, is one of the fastest growing economies worldwide, driven by the exponential growth of Muslim population demanding Shariah-compliant products and services. Globally, the Muslim population itself is expected to grow twice as fast as the non-Muslim population. The global halal market is expected to reach USD9.71 trillion by 2025 - more than 20 times the size of Malaysia's economy. The global Islamic finance assets on the other hand have already surpassed USD2 trillion last year. All these present significant opportunities for the takaful industry to provide protection and risk management solutions - be it for trade or goods in transit, for protection of physical or financial assets, and for the protection of human livelihoods. Yet, the global takaful growth ranges at only around 4% last year. While the number of takaful operators has increased to 306, the global takaful industry still accounts for less than 1% of the global insurance market. This calls for serious attention and more concerted efforts by the takaful industry worldwide to ideate and introduce solutions that can support the progress of the Muslim community. Indeed, we should also recognise that this lack of protection and coverage is holding back the economic development of the Muslim community, and it is incumbent upon us to do more to improve this.\\nTakaful as a solution of choice for Malaysians\\nHere in Malaysia, the dual financial system which also includes conventional insurance and takaful market, is well-entrenched. The operating environment presents both opportunities and challenges for the takaful industry. Undoubtedly, it must compete and present a viable alternative to the conventional insurance. At the same time, it has a unique value proposition that can meet the Muslim demand and Shariah requirements. The sustained demand for takaful, especially among Muslims, has contributed towards the industry's steady growth - from 3% market share a decade ago to almost 18% in 2018.\\nThe growth potential for takaful industry remains clear and promising. In 2018, almost half (45.8%) of the Malaysian population have yet to obtain protection. Based on a recent demand survey, 46% of Malaysian households and 48% of businesses responded that they are unaware about the comprehensive range of solutions that the takaful industry is able to offer. To reduce this gap, as an industry, takaful operators must collectively elevate the prominence of takaful and its capabilities to be a solution of choice for Malaysians. I wish to suggest three pathways for this aspiration to be realised:\\nFirst, by offering good value solutions to customers;\\nSecond, by adopting innovative tools and effective distribution strategy;\\nThird, by inculcating sound understanding of financial protection and prudent financial behaviours among Malaysians.\\nAllow me to elaborate on these . Firstly, the takaful industry has the advantage of a business model that is grounded on the values of mutual assistance and solidarity. Unlike insurance, which is premised on the buying-and-selling of risks at a premium, takaful advocates for value propositions that consumers are likely to find unique and take comfort in. Risk-sharing mechanisms in takaful, which entail greater participation of consumers in the scheme with possible rewards in the event of no claims, will appeal to many. The underlying mutuality principle allows for exploration of innovative business models that can constructively disrupt the existing risk-transfer modality. Value-adding services that complement the takaful offerings should also be optimised in designing solutions that are compatible and meaningful for consumers.\\nThe initiative this year to expand the application of value-based intermediation (VBI) to takaful is a positive step forward for the industry to promote good value solutions. The takaful industry in Malaysia has established the Task Force under the oversight of the Malaysian Takaful Association (MTA), to spearhead this development. Intuitively, we would already expect that takaful is consistently aligned with VBI. Nonetheless, we will be looking forward to the stewardship that the takaful industry can offer in innovating impactful financial protection solutions and developing framework of business practices that are solidly grounded in fairness and incorporate sustainability principles.\\nSecondly, the takaful industry must optimise the use of technology and digital infrastructures to provide premier service quality to consumers. Globally, we do see the insurance and takaful sector as one of the sectors that can benefit the most from innovative technologies such as data analytics, robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain and cloud computing. App-based insurance platforms which leverage on AI have been established to identify interests of consumers in providing niche coverage. Parametric insurance using geospatial support and big data to validate legitimate claims by farmers have been rolled-out in many parts of the world. These are all examples of technology reinvigorating the \"business-as-usual\" means of providing protection.\\nFrom our own engagements with SMEs in particular, businesses often cited that complicated and lengthy procedures remain among the top reason for not purchasing takaful. This is not a new challenge and the solutions are available for takaful operators to deploy. More targeted investment into enhancing operational capabilities is paramount for takaful operators to stay competitive. Efforts should continue to be undertaken by the industry to provide seamless customer experience by digitising operational processes, expanding distribution outreach and also upskilling the intermediaries.\\nWe also continue to be open to new proposals and would encourage players to test innovative business models and solutions in Malaysia. To date, 80 applications have been submitted under the Financial Technology Regulatory Sandbox - of which, 12 relate to insurance and takaful services. As we facilitate viability testing of these propositions, we have been gathering data and experience that will allow us to make evidence-backed regulatory adjustments, for new and incumbent market players to operate under a regulatory framework that is more risk-proportionate. This will cater for new designs of offerings and business modality, while remaining effective in promoting financial soundness and stability.\\nNonetheless, what we have seen thus far can only be characterised as digitisation of existing delivery channels and services. Going beyond this, we have yet to see true disruptions. For takaful operators, staying competitive in a digital world will require far more than just direct sales channel or automated processes. It requires a rethinking of the fundamentals and principles of takaful, for which digital technology can be a catalyst. Takaful operators must rethink their sources of revenue, operational efficiency and talent strategy to reap the opportunities of digital disruptions. It is also important to rethink the business model and the role that takaful operators can play in a digital ecosystem that has transcended geographical boundaries. Digital disruptors such as virtual or peer-to-peer takaful provider that is tech-enabled might be able to overcome many pain points experienced by the industry in more efficient ways. The buzz right now in the financial industry is around digital banks. Nonetheless, this can swiftly turn to digital insurers or takaful operators. Such development could be the next phase that could further enhance the quality and pricing of services delivered, while also penetrating new areas for the industry to achieve our protection goals. This development could provide the impetus for exponential growth in insurance and takaful penetration in the country.  \\nThirdly, the industry must take greater responsibility to educate consumers and inculcate understanding about the importance of financial protection. Almost half of respondents in the 2018 Financial Capability and Inclusion Demand Side Survey cited lack of product understanding to be the key reason for not purchasing life insurance and family takaful. While there are attempts to publicise takaful offerings, these efforts remain fragmented and lack of focus on advocating greater appreciation and understanding about the value of protection. Households and businesses remain unaware and uninformed in making decisions relating to financial protection. Recognising this persistent challenge, the Bank and the Securities Commission recently spearheaded the establishment of the Financial Education Network and the launch of the National Strategy for Financial Literacy to increase the impact of financial education initiatives and to elevate financial literacy among Malaysians. Efforts to improve financial literacy will also require industry associations to drive the development of best practices for industry-wide adoption. In this regard, the Malaysian Takaful Association should be consistently proactive and agile in responding to emerging opportunities and resolving impeding industry issues.\\nTakaful industry as a game-changer in empowering financial resilience\\nAs Malaysia advances towards the shared prosperity vision, it is crucial to ensure balanced and inclusive growth. The takaful industry has a critical role in enhancing the socio-economic well-being of Malaysians. This vision cannot be achieved without addressing the specific needs of the lower income group. According to a study by Khazanah Research Institute, people in the lower income category now have lesser residual income. The cost of living burden is the heaviest for lower income households, who spend 94.8% of their income on basic expenditure. Not much is left for savings or for financial protection in the event of misfortune. Overcoming the issue of affordability requires long-term and broader measures to grow people's income. In the interim, we can think of social finance as a vehicle to bridge this gap. The integration of social finance instrument in takaful solutions in a more structured and scalable manner can have transformative impact in making financial protection more affordable for society. Waqf, sadaqah and zakat are examples of social finance instruments which can be embedded in the design structure of takaful products. Mainstreaming the integration of social finance can unlock commercially viable financial protection to be extended to those who are most vulnerable in our society. This is definitely a unique value-added feature that can drive innovation in the area of inclusive protection.    \\nIn designing solutions to cater for the lower income segment, the takaful industry can capitalise and leverage on the principles of Perlindungan Tenang initiative, which promote protection solutions that are affordable, accessible, easy to understand, easy to buy and claim, as well as offering good protection value. Admittedly, the uptake by the industry to date has not been satisfactory. Many players cited business viability and distribution model to be among the critical challenges in advancing this initiative beyond corporate social responsibility. This is something that takaful operators, as an industry, would need to overcome. We will need to apply unconventional thinking and take bold steps to create an ecosystem that is more enabling for microtakaful solutions to be implemented in a sustainable manner. On the Bank's part, we have initiated a review of the relevant regulatory framework to spur the development of inclusive protection. A consultative paper will be issued by end of the year for industry to give its feedback.\\nConclusion\\nAs the takaful industry matures, all stakeholders will continue to set higher expectations. Consumers today expect seamless experience and quality service in every aspect of the business operation. Shareholders, of course, expect financial entities to offer sustainable returns on investments while exploring innovative business opportunities. Regulators expect financial institutions to adopt business strategies and operational models that are sustainable and value-adding to the economy and society.\\nThe window of opportunity for takaful to deliver meaningful propositions for all its stakeholders is wide open. The takaful industry must step up with strong stewardship towards meeting these expectations. I believe the discussion at this conference today can help us better navigate the path towards purposeful transformation of the takaful industry. I look forward to engaging dialogues ahead and productive sessions with all of you. Thank you."

        "content": "How pessimistic are you about the state of the European economy at the moment?\\nWe have a sort of two-tier economy: on the one side, we have manufacturing and exports, and on the other, we have services and domestic demand. Manufacturing and exports are clearly underperforming the rest of the economy; that's why we have some differences among euro area countries. Germany, for example, is much more exposed to the external sector. That's our baseline scenario. But I think the most important point is not so much that the projection has been revised downwards several times, but that we have not included in the baseline the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, or even an escalation of trade tensions. If these downward risks materialise, the growth outlook will deteriorate further, from already very low levels.\\nGlobal economic activity has been slowing for some time. The United States and China are engaged in an ongoing trade dispute and the manufacturing sector in Europe, and Germany in particular, has been hard hit. How much longer can the ECB - and indeed fiscal authorities if they were to loosen the purse strings - continue to prop up the eurozone economy under those circumstances?\\nThe capacity of monetary policy to address these types of shocks is not unlimited. We are not almighty; we have to be humble. Other actors have to step in. I'm referring to structural reforms, to fiscal policy, the completion of the capital markets union and the completion of the banking union. If we have an orderly Brexit, if trade disputes are de-escalated, that will be positive for the European and world economy. But the message is that monetary policy cannot address all the problems in the world. We are not the saviours of the world.\\nYou've been portrayed as a rather reluctant supporter of the package that was announced on 12 September. Is that fair? Were there aspects of the package that you supported more or less than others?\\nI've always had a very clear approach to the way we make our decisions. This is a collegial institution, a collegial forum. It's very simple: once a decision has been taken - and the majority of decisions are taken with unanimity - you have to defend that decision. There are 25 of us and, for sure, there are sometimes different views, but when a decision is taken by a clear majority, it is important to defend it. It would be much better if we tried to reduce the level of surrounding noise.\\nWould it have been difficult for President Draghi to push the package through had a majority of the Executive Board been against it?\\nThe basis of the package was the outlook. Inflation expectations are not de-anchoring, but there is a potential risk that they could do so, and the threat of deflation could come to the fore. That's why we reacted. The core element of the package was forward guidance. People have not paid much attention to that, but in my view, that was the main, important message. And afterwards we took other measures: cutting the interest rate, \"tiering\", targeted longer-term refinancing operations, and finally the asset purchase programme (APP). But forward guidance is the main element and the core reference for how things can evolve in the near future.\\nOne central bank governor recently suggested life would be much easier for the ECB if it simply accepted inflation rates at closer to 1% than 2%. Where do you stand?\\nOur remit is to achieve price stability, and price stability according to our present definition is below, but close to, 2%. Whether it is symmetric or not is a different question - while it's not a minor question, it's not the most important one either. The third element we are perhaps overlooking is the reaction function: how powerful our instruments are in their ability to push up inflation. I think that's the real point. We have not entered into discussion over whether the target should be modified. It will be discussed by the Governing Council and perhaps with a new president it will be different. But for me the kind of monetary policy decisions you take and the tools you have to achieve the target are much more important.\\nIt's been argued that tiering is in effect a rate increase-..\\nNo, I don't think so. Tiering is a form of mitigation. That's why it was set.\\nIs it a form of mitigation that lays the ground for further rate cuts?\\nWe haven't discussed it, but my impression is that -0.50% is the correct level at present, and as to any further cut, we will have a good, in-depth discussion in the Governing Council. One point that I think is particularly relevant is that although we can reduce interest rates further, the side effects of monetary policy are becoming more and more evident and more and more tangible. That's why we have started to say that other actors have to jump in.\\nDoes tiering help or impede the process of banks restructuring in ways that might offset the negative effects of negative interest rates?\\nThis is a good question. Tiering is some relief, but the reasons for the banks' low profitability are different. Low interest rates are having an impact, but they're not the main cause of European banks' problems, which are much more structural. Some have argued that even tiering, by offering relief, delays the implementation of the instruments that could improve the European banks' profitability. That is a big problem. We are in a changing paradigm. Low interest rates are going to be around for longer, and this has very little to do with monetary policy. Monetary policy has to adapt to the lower level of the natural interest rate, and we are going to hit the zero lower bound much more often than in the past. This has implications for monetary policy, but also for the banking industry, for the insurance business, for everyone.\\nFollowing the restart of the APP, Philip Lane said recently that the question of a shortage of bonds \"may not become a problem for an extended period of time, and in any case not for at least as long as we can project bond availability conditions with some confidence.\" How long is an extended period of time?\\nOur calculation is that we have enough time.\\nBut there are some who might argue that the APP was only introduced at the level it was [\\u20ac20 billion per month] because any higher and you run out of things to buy very quickly indeed-\\nI don't think so. Our assessment was that \\u20ac20 billion was enough in terms of the current situation and the evolution of the ECB's balance sheet, and not just in terms of the restrictions that we could hit.\\nSo there is still further headroom should it be necessary. Is that the message?\\nHeadroom is there, and \\u20ac20 billion per month dovetails perfectly with the headroom we have. It will be in place for a period of time. This is a package, and the concept of a package is that you can't move it every two weeks. The package has to be stable, and we have to be predictable. So if we start saying that we can modify some elements or some parameters within it, we start to undermine its effectiveness. But, again, we are not the only game in town.\\nIt sounds like you're ruling out any changes at the next meeting.\\nThat will depend on the Governing Council. We will have to see what happens with the outlook. And we will have to see what happens with the downside risks.\\nIs helicopter money something you would ever consider appropriate, or does it blur too much the boundaries between fiscal and monetary policy?\\nWe need to have an independent budgetary instrument at euro area level with a countercyclical function and institutional governance that is different from the present set of rules. There should be an independent fiscal authority that can determine when there is an asymmetric shock or a problem across the euro area, and then react. And that is something that could be decided as we decide monetary policy. It would simultaneously reduce the burden of national fiscal policy.\\nDoes that mean that it's going to be difficult for Christine Lagarde to make any changes to the package we have?\\nThe president is very important, because the president sets the agenda and sometimes even the timing of the decisions we take. And afterwards he or she has a very important role in creating consensus, as the more consensus we have, the better for the institution, also in terms of effectiveness of the decisions. But the president aside, the rest of the Governing Council is going to be more or less the same, and this is a collegial institution. And the concept of a package is something you can use perhaps once a year, but not every month, because otherwise you undermine its effectiveness.\\nIs there a sense in which a new president is like pressing the reset button? Or is it more a straightforward case of institutional continuity?\\nStrong institutions always have a certain kind of continuity, but the new president is the new president, and she will have her own ideas and approaches to the organisation. But a policy U-turn is something I would discard. And it would not be good anyway."

        "title": "Mugur Is\\u0103rescu: Transformation of Central and Eastern European economies - lessons learned and the way forward",
        "content": "Ladies and gentlemen,\\nI am honoured to speak at this conference about a highly topical issue in front of such a distinguished audience. I believe it is a good opportunity to look back at the macroeconomic and financial developments in Central and Eastern European countries and, based on the past decades' experience, to look forward into the future of these economies, also from the perspective of euro adoption.\\nGenerally speaking, the transition from a centrally-planned to a market economy proved to be a much more difficult task than it was first believed. The transition model was designed based on the concepts prevailing in the western countries in the early '90s: free markets, globalisation and ensuring security and development via NATO and EU membership. With the benefit of hindsight, I can say now that not many knew exactly what the right thing to do was, relevant experience was lacking, and every model - be it shock therapy or gradual reform strategy - proved to have its limits, so it was rather learning by doing. It was a time of experiments and many reforms were carried out in a sui generis manner. I dare say this as a veteran, serving also one year as a Prime Minister in 2000.\\nIn time, several aspects of transition differed from one country to another: smaller countries, such as the Baltic states or Slovenia and Slovakia, opted for a fast track towards Eurozone entry, inter alia because of geopolitical and security reasons, while states with larger and more complex economies, such as Poland, Hungary, Czechia or Romania, focused their efforts more on internal development. For instance, in Poland there is talk of \"Polish-ization\" and \"nationalisation\" of development, the spotlight being on the requirement to increase the country's power resources: \"if you cannot stand on your own feet, no one will listen to you\". In Romania, we had a very difficult transition in the first post-communist decade, with half-hearted, gradual reform, yet after 2000 our economy has evolved more coherently, having two important anchors: the EU and NATO.\\nEvents that were hard to foresee in the early '90s took place as well. For instance, who would have thought that Slovakia, the less developed part of Czechoslovakia, would join the euro area and Czechia would not? Under the circumstances, does euro adoption testify to a high development level? Who would have thought that Balcerowicz, the initiator of shock therapy in Poland, whose name will always be linked to its transition from a centrally-planned economy to a market economy, considered a hero of reforms in the '90s and even before the global crisis, would become now a sort of scapegoat for the less positive aspects of transition - the leader of Law and Justice Party in Poland, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, committed to \" finally reject the unfortunate concepts of the pest Balcerowicz\"1 .\\nI don't have now the time to discuss in detail these complex processes or the differences between countries. I am sure that this conference will lay another brick to the better understanding of these processes. My intervention aims at sharing with you a few lessons that I am formulating from my present position as a central banker.\\nThe first lesson I would like to mention refers precisely to real convergence. In almost two decades, all CEE economies have made significant progress - at various paces - in terms of real convergence, with the catching-up process benefiting substantially from their EU accession. In Romania's case, GDP per capita as a percentage of euro area average (based on PPS) expanded almost threefold compared to the year 2000, reaching 61 percent in 2018. Poland and Hungary stand at around 67 percent (both posting values of no more than 45 percent in 2000), Czechia at 86 percent (from 61 percent in 2000) and Bulgaria at 47 percent (against 24 percent in 2000).\\nAs a matter of fact, Romania boasts the fastest growth rate in the group of peer countries with similar trends. Can we, therefore, say that this is proof of a successful catching-up in real terms? Furthermore, can we claim that having a flexible policy framework (including a managed floating exchange rate) helped us in this respect? Allow me to assert that more time is needed in order for these questions to be appropriately answered. However, a general remark can be made: the EU and NATO anchors helped us all make progress as concerns real convergence.\\nThe second lesson derives from the answer to the following question: did the strategic decisions on the exchange rate regime and monetary policy framework matter? It is known that some countries in the region (Romania, Poland, Czechia, Hungary) opted for flexible exchange rate arrangements and adopted inflation targeting, while others (Bulgaria and the Baltic states) resorted to a fixed exchange rate regime under a currency board. At first sight, it seems that the latter group of countries are better prepared in terms of euro adoption (the Baltic states have already taken this step but they, being much smaller and more open economies, are a special case), given the fiscal discipline pursued and the nominal convergence stage in those economies. This has helped keep macroeconomic imbalances under control, yet the flipside of the coin is that the pace of real convergence was slowed by these powerful constraints, at least in the aforementioned case of Bulgaria.\\nConsequently, it can be said that both approaches have benefits and drawbacks and that the story of these economies on their catching-up journey is still far from over. I would point out that there are resources for all these economies to continue to grow relatively fast. While convergence will go on, it is unsure at what pace, how linear and how sustainable it will be, and the surprises that the future has in store for us are difficult to foresee, just like the recent past differed from what we could have forecasted two decades earlier, for instance.\\nThe third lesson concerns the manner in which the global economic and financial crisis was weathered. With only one exception (Poland, which has not seen a single year of recession precisely because it managed to adequately combine exchange rate flexibility and fiscal discipline), all CEE economies witnessed periods of economic decline - more or less severe, shorter or longer - owing to the crisis, irrespective of their exchange rate or monetary policy regimes. The steepest decline was in Romania, which had to undergo the most painful fiscal adjustment. This occurred because the fiscal policy during the pre-crisis boom had been strongly procyclical, so that the economic advance of over 9 percent in 2008 was followed by sharp falls in the next two years: -5.5 percent in 2009 and -3.9 percent in 2010. The lesson learned here is that there is no viable alternative to a predictable and coherent mix of economic policies and structural reforms. Let me stress that this mix should remain in place even when facing the challenges of election years, and there are several election rounds in Romania in 2019 and 2020.\\nThe fourth lesson could deal with the issue of whether joining the euro area ensures faster growth or not. I attended the celebrations marking the 10th anniversary of euro adoption in Slovenia and Slovakia. While in the latter country euro area membership is considered a success story, in Slovenia it is viewed as a necessary, yet painful, step. During my conversation with a Slovenian expert, I argued that the difficulties faced after euro adoption were the consequence of not cleaning up banks' balance sheets before euro area entry. He replied that the people were not interested in these details, as what they cared about most was the standard of living, which declined after the euro changeover.\\nWhile this could be in itself regarded as a lesson, I will go further and add that the recent views expressed by policymakers in Hungary and Poland appear to favour the idea that euro area membership contains the room for growth.\\nA number of public statements are relevant in this respect. The Hungarian Prime Minister, Viktor Orb\\xe1n, said in April 2013 that \"Hungary cannot seriously consider joining the euro zone until the country's average economic development reaches 90 percent of the level of euro states\". Poland's former central bank governor Marek Belka stated in 2015: \"You shouldn't rush when there is still smoke coming from a house that was burning- As long as the eurozone has problems with some of its own members, don't expect us to be enthusiastic about joining\". His successor at the helm of the monetary authority in Poland, Adam Glapi\\u0144ski, said that - and I quote - \"We will not give up on the zloty (currency), because it will dramatically limit growth opportunities for the Polish economy\".\\nBack in 2001, Leszek Balcerowicz noted that structural reforms are those that harmonise nominal and real convergence, as there are also unavoidable tensions between the two. The more comprehensive the structural reforms, the less costly the disinflation and the more robust the economic growth over the long term.\\nBeno\\xeet C\\u0153ur\\xe9, a member of the ECB's Executive Board, provided an overall view when pointing out, in November 2018, that the Central, Eastern and South-Eastern economies were characterised by an uneven level of convergence and that the smaller ones (from Slovenia to the Baltic states) joined the euro area irrespective of their progress in this area. Larger economies were in no hurry to adopt the euro, but rather focused in the first place on correcting some structural issues as long as the economic policy framework still enjoyed a certain flexibility.\\nLet me now tell you how we addressed these issues in my country. Romania chose rather to take the middle way in approaching euro adoption, envisaging a real convergence level of at least 70-75 percent prior to entering the euro area, as a lower level would cause us to be severely affected by asymmetric shocks and therefore be unable to synchronise our business cycle with that of other euro area economies. As for the Maastricht criteria, from July 2015 to November 2017, Romania fulfilled all the convergence criteria in the Treaty (yet without participating in the Exchange Rate Mechanism). The fact that, at this moment, the reference values for the long-term interest rate and inflation are no longer complied with is a warning that efforts should be undertaken to attain nominal convergence in a lasting manner, not accidentally or temporarily. This is feasible only when the two types of convergence reinforce each other.\\nThe inherent flexibility of a managed float regime such as the one pursued by the NBR does, however, have its clear limitations, which should not be overlooked - this does not imply, by any means, that the central bank acts in a discretionary manner, taking the exchange rate wherever it wants. The abuse of flexibility can be as harmful to the proper functioning of the economy as the abuse of rigidity. In fact, the inflation-targeting regime implemented by the NBR is a mix of rules and discretion with the aim of formulating a coherent and effective monetary policy.\\nAs regards the current differences in the countries' approaches to euro adoption, for some it might seem odd that Bulgaria, which lags behind in terms of real convergence, is considering joining the euro area sooner than Romania. It is only natural for our neighbour to contemplate euro adoption as the only sound exit from the present currency board. By contrast, in Romania, as well as in other countries pursuing a floating exchange rate regime, the approach is different, since euro adoption is more complex. This is by no means to say that Romania does not envisage joining the euro area, but merely that a comprehensive preparation is of the essence to cope with the related challenges.\\nThe Latin dictum festina lente is, in my opinion, quite suitable in the case of euro adoption as well. With respect to real convergence, many have been asking themselves \"How fast is fast enough?\". Unlike others, I would not necessarily look for a certain figure (beyond the already mentioned minimum level of roughly 70-75 percent); I would tackle this issue by approaching real convergence not as a race where the fastest track is also the right one, but rather as a complex process giving the steady runner (a marathoner rather than a sprinter) the opportunity to reap most of the potential benefits, while avoiding excessive risks.\\nSpeaking about risks, it is worth noting that relatively sizeable current account and fiscal deficits may erode the very foundation of this edifice that is the national economy. It is therefore much wiser to adjust them in a gradual manner than leave market forces to cause a sudden correction.\\nFiscal discipline, consistent economic policies and an ambitious, yet viable, calendar should make a successful euro adoption possible, so that the economy adequately withstand competitive pressures within the euro area. Equally important is to reduce the still overly large disparities across Romania's development regions, as it takes the entire country to join the euro area, not only Bucharest and Ilfov county. Economic growth is not enough, it should be accompanied by lasting economic development.\\nBefore ending my speech, instead of my personal view about the future, let me quote a recent column in Financial Times by Tony Barber2 relevant for the state of affairs in the region: \"Nevertheless all is not well in the region. Why? One reason lies in the model that western governments in the 1990s prescribed for the east's transition to free-market democracy. As it shed its communist past, the east was told to embrace not just liberal democracy but globalisation, open borders and the lightly regulated financial capitalism that the west viewed as the touchstone of its own economic success.\\nThis model's flaws were exposed in the 2008 financial crisis and the European refugee and migrant emergency of 2015-16. [-]\\nEU membership, too, has brought more pluses than minuses. Access to the single market, regional aid and, from ordinary people's viewpoint, Europe-wide freedom of movement are cherished gains. [-]\\nThis resentment has much to do with the western model grafted on to the east. In 1989, as during Europe's 1848 revolutions, the people wanted civic freedoms and, in many cases, liberation from foreign overlords and their first independent states of modern times. But after 1989 the adoption of the western model - complete with EU membership, global capitalism and a liberal political philosophy - created tensions between liberalism allied to internationalism and the assertion of a newly acquired national sovereignty. [-]\\nNow central and eastern Europe is experiencing its own contest between populist nationalism and liberal democracy. It would be brave to forecast a winner when some western societies are caught up in much the same struggle.\"\\nThis being said, let me thank you for your attention and wish you insightful discussions.\\n1 \"Poland's wild ride out of communism remains election faultline\", James Shotter, Financial Times, 2 October 2019.\\n2 \"The legacy of 1989 has been complacency\", Tony Barber, Financial Times, 2 October 2019."

        "content": "Introduction\\nGood morning everyone. It is my great pleasure to be here at the Asia Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (ASIFMA) annual conference 2019. I am honored to address this distinguished audience comprised of representatives from the securities and asset management industries, institutional investors, policy makers, and regulators in Asia and other important regions.\\nAsia's capital markets have experienced remarkable growth since the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s. Asia's share of global stock market capitalization soared from 1 percent in 2000 to 15 percent in 2017. Notably, the amount outstanding in local currency bond markets in Asia as a share of GDP in 2018 increased to more than double that in 2000 (Chart 1). Obviously, the rapid expansion of Asian economies has driven the growth of the capital markets in the region. At the same time, the collective efforts of market participants, policy makers, and regulators both at national and regional levels have contributed to market liberalization and enhancement of market infrastructures in Asia."

        "title": "Luigi Federico Signorini: Macroprudential policy - effectiveness, interactions and spillovers",
        "content": "It is my pleasure to welcome you to the fourth Macroprudential Policy Group research workshop. We are honoured to host an event that has become one of the most important opportunities to discuss macroprudential policy in Europe. I would like to thank the organisers, the keynote speaker, the contributors to the four sessions and the panellists for the roundtable that will conclude the conference this afternoon.\\nThe papers to be presented today cover a wide array of topics and will help us to understand crucial features of the transmission mechanism of macroprudential policies. They take stock of the experience accumulated in recent years across the euro area. They also strive to contribute to the development of a measure of the prudential stance, an endeavour that I have always advocated as essential for the conduct of macroprudential policy. Let me spend a few words on this point.\\nThe concept of stance should convey information on the overall impact of the policy instruments that have been implemented, on their adequacy in meeting policy objectives given the identified risks, and on the required policy orientation. A credible stance would help to enhance policy communication, reinforce transmission channels and counter potential inaction biases.\\nCertain steps towards setting a framework for a macroprudential stance in the EU have been taken. A notable contribution is a recent European Systemic Risk Board publication, which proposes a \"risk-resilience\" framework to define the macroprudential stance. In that framework, the amount of systemic risk faced by the financial sector is compared to the level of resilience against negative shocks stemming from microprudential provisions, regulatory aspects or public safety nets, and the additional resilience created by the active macroprudential tools. The macroprudential stance is defined as loose or tight depending on whether the difference between risk and resilience is above or below some  pre-specified level that measures the risk tolerance of the authorities, and thus, the \"neutral\" policy stance.\\nThis is an interesting framework and I certainly welcome it as a good starting point for a policy discussion. It is a high-level framework, however, and certain concepts need further development. Without any claim to being exhaustive, I would like to mention three important dimensions along which I think the approach could be further improved.\\nFirst, the boundary between the effects of micro and macroprudential policies is more artificial than real. The two, while different in purpose, share instruments and are directed to the same participants in the financial markets. Indeed, it is the overall level of micro and macroprudential requirements that affects the ability of the financial system to finance the real economy, both in normal and stressed times. Consequently, a narrow notion of the macroprudential stance should, in my opinion, be replaced with the more comprehensive one of an overall prudential stance, one that would account for how both categories of prudential measures affect the economy. Let me emphasise that this is not just a question of semantics. Microprudential capital requirements, for instance, have been substantially increased after the crisis. In the short run, the contractionary effects on the credit cycle associated with such an increase were, directionally and qualitatively, of the same nature as those associated with the activation of a cyclical buffer. This of course does not mean that it was wrong to do it; an increase in the quantity and quality of bank capital was required to strengthen the banking system, in light of all the shortcomings of the old supervisory rules that the crisis had exposed. However, it was clear to all that there was a price to pay for this, in terms of tighter credit: at least temporarily, during the transition to the new standards. An overall prudential stance measure would capture this policy tightening; a narrower perspective misses it. Had the former existed, it would have supplied valuable input, for instance, to the discussion on transitional arrangements. The discussion took place anyway, because regulators were qualitatively aware of the issue, but in a sort of informational vacuum.\\nI would thus suggest to devote further thought to such issues of definition.\\nThe conceptual framework should also more explicitly capture the idea that one central aim of macroprudential policies is to limit the endogenous pro-cyclicality of the financial sector. Risks tend to be underestimated by market participants during booms and overestimated in busts, resulting in an amplification of cycles. To lean against this procyclical pattern in risk perceptions, the framework for the macroprudential stance should have a clear cyclical perspective. One might also note that, in normal macro-economic discourse, \"neutral\" is a factual assessment of the stance and is not synonymous with \"right\"; in certain cases policymakers wish to have a loose, in other cases a tight stance. One way to set this idea within the ESRB conceptual framework might be to say that the macroprudential authorities would need to lower their risk tolerance in booms and thus activate  contractionary policies early; symmetrically, they would increase their risk tolerance as booms turn to busts, and thus provide accommodative policy and support growth when the cycle weakens. But whatever the specific phrasing, a more prominent cyclical element would, in my view, be welcome.\\nThe use of macroprudential tools, especially the more wide-ranging ones such as the countercyclical buffer, should always be carefully considered in this light. Timing is essential. We may or may not be able one day to fine-tune the prudential stance so as to define an \"optimal policy rule\" over the cycle but, as a minimum, we should be alert to the risk that the countercyclical buffer may end up to be used like a procyclical one. \"Better late than never\" is a poor guide to countercyclical action; the Hippocratic injunction to physicians, \"First, do no harm\", is more apt. An objective evaluation of the stance, and a cyclical benchmark against which to measure it, would be most useful in this respect. This is an important reason why I look forward to any progress in this field, whether we can ever fine-tune macroprudential policy or not.\\nMy third and final point on conceptual issues is that, ideally, the prudential stance should also account for the interaction of macroprudential policies across countries. Euro-area countries are deeply integrated. During stress periods, this may lead financial instability in one country to propagate to other countries, if an inaction bias prevails; the same holds, again symmetrically, for the effect of contractionary measures. How, and to what extent, this can be done is, I think, a matter for further potentially valuable reflection.\\nBefore concluding, let me add that a different issue is sometimes raised about the relationship between monetary and macroprudential policy. This is an important and complex issue and it would not be possible for me to discuss it here at any meaningful length. Let me however make one observation that applies especially to tailored macroprudential policies, i.e., the ones that are aimed at preventing instability in specific markets. Such measures, I would argue, are best seen as working, not as a restraint on, but as a complement to, monetary policy. The latter is, by nature, pervasive, and as such it can have unwanted side-effects in certain areas or markets. Should such pockets of vulnerability emerge, authorities can activate tailored macroprudential policies to tackle them. In this context, macroprudential measures do not aim at \"neutralizing\" the effects of monetary policy. Rather, a targeted use of macroprudential tools creates more room for manoeuvre for monetary policy to follow its price-stability mandate. Recently, various euro-area countries have adopted macro measures to contain imbalances in the real estate sector, sometimes in response to the ESRB's warnings or recommendations. This is, in my view, a successful example of how monetary and macroprudential policies can complement each other.\\n*    *    *\\nIt is time for me to close this address. I look forward to the valuable exchange of experiences, insights and evidence that will take place during this conference. I am sure it will help us improve our understanding of the way macroprudential tools can be best used to satisfy our financial stability mandate, and to complement other macroeconomic tools. I thank you all for your participation and your attention."

        "content": "Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear Colleagues and Friends,\\nIt is my great honour and pleasure to welcome you to the 70th Economic Policy Panel Meeting.\\nEconomic Policy - the journal, that is - has had an invaluable impact on economists and policymakers in Europe since its establishment by Georges De Menil, Richard Portes, David Begg and Charles Wyplosz in 1985. So many thanks to the current managing editors (Thorsten Beck, Andrea Ichino, Beata Javorcik and Tommaso Monacelli) as well as senior editors (Pierre Cahuc, Kevin Hjortsh\\xf8j and Klaus Schmidt) for continuing this great tradition. For a frequent reader of Economic Policy like myself it is indeed a great pleasure and honour to open this panel.\\nIn my opening remarks I would like to maintain that the current global economic situation calls for interaction between different policy areas. Many of the challenges that we are facing are beyond the mandates of central banks and should be addressed through fiscal and structural policies. Better policy coordination - or policy mix - is key for better economic outcomes, especially since the monetary policy space is limited.\\nIn the euro area, growth has decelerated to about 1% and is not forecast to meaningfully pick up in the immediate years ahead. Although a recession has been so far avoided, the balance of risks is tilted to the downside.\\nThere is a long list of short- and long-term factors that contribute to this weak economic outlook, like the expanding trade wars and a possible hard Brexit, as well as vulnerabilities in the emerging markets and geopolitical turbulences in the Middle East. Europe faces its own structural problems, such as population ageing, declining productivity growth, as well as populism and indebtedness. Last but not least, there is the overwhelming challenge of mitigation of and adjustment to global warming.\\nSimilarly, inflation in the euro area has continued to fall short with respect to the ECB's target, and the inflation outlook is projected to remain subdued well into the future. In response to that, the Governing Council of the ECB substantially increased monetary accommodation at its meeting on September 12th. With this decision, financing conditions will remain accommodative for an extended period and will contribute to the euro area's growth outlook, both short-term and long-term.\\nIt has been recently argued that there has not been danger of a deflationary spiral in the euro area. I for one have to say that I don't remember or see it that way in light of the empirical evidence. For instance, the European Commission in 2013-14 was very concerned about the spectre of deflation, and expressed that also publicly.\\nOn its part, in January 2015, the ECB launched an expanded asset purchase programme, since the degree of monetary accommodation prevailing at the time was insufficient to adequately address the heightened risks of a prolonged period of low inflation. HICP inflation had indeed been below 1 % since October 2013, and the reasons for low inflation, which were long seen only as temporary, started to indicate second round effects with a deflationary impact.\\nIn January 2015, the overall HICP inflation rate was only at 0.6%. Moreover, the markets were pricing negative inflation in the time horizon of 2-3 years with the probability of about 50%. The degree of monetary policy accommodation was examined and reinforced many times since then. Only in June 2018 was the Governing Council able to conclude that progress towards a sustained adjustment in inflation had been substantial.\\nThe threat of a deflationary spiral was subsequently avoided. A key lesson of monetary policy of the last 10 years is that timely action is essential to avoid the zero lower bound and an extended period of too low inflation. We don't want to be in the midst of a deflationary spiral until we take action. This is also one of the key lessons of the Japanese experience.\\nFast-forward to early 2019. Due to the rapidly worsening outlook, the normalisation of monetary policy that started in June 2018 had to be put on hold. The decisions to restart the easing phase in March this year and to resume the net asset purchases in September were timely and taken in response to the continued shortfall of inflation with respect to our aim.\\nLadies and Gentlemen,\\nWhile I have focused on monetary policy, many factors that weaken the economic outlook originate beyond its realm. Yet the connection between seemingly non-monetary challenges and risk factors on the one hand, and monetary policy on the other, is actually much stronger than initially appears. This is because many of these challenges, if more permanent, have the potential of affecting the natural level of real interest rates. A good example is the ageing of the societies with persistently declining shares of youngest cohorts. Moreover, there are frictions in education and labour mobility that can further diminish the productivity potential of younger generations. All these factors lower aggregate investment and demand for capital. If they don't reduce aggregate income and savings at the same time, they can ultimately lower the natural rate of interest.\\nWhy do these mechanisms matter for monetary policy? Because the lower the natural interest-rate level is, the higher is the probability that nominal interest rates are near the effective lower bound -  \"hitting the floor\", if you like. A prolonged period of zero interest rates combined with low inflation could in turn trap the economy in a profoundly harmful equilibrium, which would undermine the effectiveness of monetary policy, constrain economic growth below its potential and hinder efforts to boost employment.\\nLet me be clear. We all, I assume, would like to get rid of negative interest rates. However, as long as the synchronized slowdown continues, there is no economically meaningful alternative to unconventional monetary policies - and it is better to be safe than sorry before shifting the policy gear back to normalization. At the same time, all countries and jurisdictions would do well by applying effective macroprudential policies to counter any negative side effects of accommodative monetary policy.\\nFurthermore, there are also new uncertainties and possibly fundamental changes in the functioning of the economy. Low interest rates, low inflation and persistently low growth put our economic theories and past empirical relationships into a real test.\\nFacing these challenges, many central banks, including the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada, are currently reviewing their monetary policy strategies. The Bank of Finland has been making the case for a strategy review for the ECB. Central banks in the European System of Central Banks have also invested in active research departments to analyse the implications of the new economic environment and new policy instruments, both for the conduct of monetary policy and its modelling.\\nA strategy review referred to by Christine Lagarde would provide us with an opportunity to conduct a thorough scientific assessment of our monetary policy framework and evaluate its effectiveness in light of the new economic landscape and new monetary policy instruments. \\nFiscal policies remain more fragmented, uncoordinated and reacting at a much slower pace. This is especially the case in the euro area, which consists of 19 member states, all having separate fiscal and political cycles.\\nThe challenges in the domain of governments and fiscal authorities are both long- and short-run in nature. Good examples of long-run structural issues are competitiveness and global warming. Structural reforms can boost productivity and growth potential, and reduce structural unemployment, especially in times of ageing population.\\nHowever, fiscal policy has also the potential of affecting economic activity in the short run to stabilize the business cycle. As stressed by President Mario Draghi, automatic stabilizers should be able to play their full role. Clearly, euro area economies are heterogeneous in terms of their indebtedness and fiscal constraints. However, in countries where fiscal space is available, fiscal measures should be actively pursued, particularly towards the financing of public investment.\\nWhat are the tasks of central banks in this division of labour? Recent studies, such as those on the experiences of Japan over the past decades, demonstrate that declining inflation expectations can become permanently stuck at low levels. This can lead the economy into a prolonged period of low inflation, where monetary policy has little room for manoeuvre. To prevent the anchoring of expectations at a level below target, central banks need to respond early enough and powerfully enough to bring about convergence to the price stability target, in situations where inflation expectations have become depressed for a protracted period.\\nDear Colleagues and Friends,\\nI was very excited to see the list of papers chosen for this panel. The selection covers most of the issues that I have mentioned before: structural reforms, expanding trade wars and the optimal policy mix.\\nThis simply confirms the role of Economic Policy as the pivotal journal for policy-relevant research in Europe and beyond.\\nSo, without further ado, let me pass the ball to the chair of the first session. But before that, let me wish you a substantive and productive conference!\\nMany thanks for your attention."

        "content": "I. Recent Economic and Price Developments\\nA. Overseas Developments\\nI would like to begin by talking about overseas economies, which have been growing moderately on the whole, although slowdowns have continued to be observed. In terms of the outlook, slowdowns are likely to continue for the time being; thereafter, however, overseas economies are expected to grow moderately on the whole with their growth rates rising somewhat. According to the July 2019 World Economic Outlook Update released by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), global growth is forecast at 3.2 percent for 2019 and 3.5 percent for 2020. However, as downside risks concerning the global economy seem to be increasing, careful attention is warranted on the timing and pace of its pick-up.\\nLooking at developments by major region, the U.S. economy has been expanding moderately, although relatively weak developments have been observed in the manufacturing sector. The European economy has remained in its deceleration phase. The Chinese economy has continued to see stable growth on the whole, but weakness has been observed in the manufacturing sector. Other emerging and commodity-exporting economies have maintained their recovery trend as domestic demand has been firm on the whole. As for the outlook, the U.S. economy is expected to maintain its moderate expansion and the European economy is projected to gradually move out of its deceleration phase. The Chinese economy is likely to broadly follow a stable growth path as authorities implement fiscal and monetary policies in a gradual manner. The growth rates of other emerging and commodity-exporting economies are likely to rise on the whole, mainly on the back of the effects of those economies' stimulus measures.\\nRisk factors to the overseas economic outlook are wide ranging and likely to be significant, as exemplified by (1) the U.S. macroeconomic policies and their impact on global financial markets, (2) the consequences of protectionist moves, including those observed in the U.S.-China trade friction, and their effects, (3) developments in emerging and commodity-exporting economies, (4) the progress in global adjustments in IT-related goods, (5) negotiations on the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union (EU) and their effects, and (6) geopolitical risks. In particular, uncertainties regarding the effects of protectionist moves have been heightening. As it can be said that the situation surrounding overseas economies is uncertain, it is necessary to stay vigilant regarding these risk factors, including their impact on the sentiment of firms and households in Japan.\\nB. Japan's Economy and Prices\\n1. Economic activity\\nI will now discuss the economic situation in Japan. The economy has been on a moderate expanding trend, with a virtuous cycle from income to spending operating, although exports, production, and business sentiment have been affected by the slowdown in overseas economies. This is evidenced by the real GDP growth rate having registered 1.3 percent for the April-June quarter of 2019 on an annualized quarter-on-quarter basis, representing positive growth for three consecutive quarters. While the contribution of net exports on real GDP growth has turned negative, that of domestic demand has remained positive. According to the Bank of Japan's September 2019 Tankan (Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan) released at the beginning of October, the diffusion index (DI) for business conditions for all industries and enterprises has remained positive, although the effects of such factors as the slowdown in overseas economies have continued to be observed.\\nWith regard to the outlook, Japan's economy is likely to continue on a moderate expanding trend on average, although it is projected to be affected by the slowdown in overseas economies for the time being and due attention needs to be paid to the effects of the October 2019 consumption tax hike on private consumption. In terms of specific figures for the economic growth rate, as provided in the July 2019 Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report) released by the Bank, the medians of the Policy Board members' forecasts are 0.7 percent for fiscal 2019, 0.9 percent for fiscal 2020, and 1.1 percent for fiscal 2021. The Bank estimates that the economic growth rate that can be achieved in the long term, or the so-called potential growth rate, is in the range of 0.5-1.0 percent. Thus, Japan's economy is expected to continue growing at a pace consistent with its potential.\\nTo elaborate on Japan's economy by demand component, exports are projected to continue showing some weakness for the time being, but thereafter are expected to return to their moderate increasing trend as the growth rates of overseas economies rise. Domestic demand is likely to follow a moderate uptrend. Specifically, business fixed investment is expected to increase moderately amid highly accommodative financial conditions. Private consumption also is likely to continue on a moderate increasing trend as the employment and income situation continues to improve steadily. However, it is necessary to pay close attention to the effects of the consumption tax hike on private consumption.\\n2. Prices\\nLet me now turn to price developments. The year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) for all items less fresh food and that for all items excluding the effects of energy prices are both at around 0.5 percent, together suggesting that the CPI has continued to show relatively weak developments compared to the economic expansion and tight labor market conditions.\\nHowever, with the economy continuing on an expanding trend, the mechanism for moderate increases in wages and prices driven by a positive output gap has continued to operate. Thus, with regard to the outlook, medium- to long-term inflation expectations are projected to rise gradually as firms' stance is likely to gradually shift toward further raising wages and prices. As a result, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is likely to increase gradually over time. In terms of specific figures, the medians of the Policy Board members' forecasts of the year-on-year rate of change presented in the July 2019 Outlook Report are 1.0 percent for fiscal 2019, 1.3 percent for fiscal 2020, and 1.6 percent for fiscal 2021.1\\nThe forecasts assume the following: (1) the consumption tax will be raised to 10 percent in October 2019 and a reduced tax rate will be applied to food and beverages -- excluding alcohol and dining out -- and newspapers, and (2) measures for free early childhood education will be introduced in October 2019, and other measures including free higher education will be introduced in April 2020.\\nII. Keys to Assessing the Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices\\nIn what follows, I would like to discuss several points that I think deserve particular attention in examining whether the outlook for economic activity and prices in Japan that I mentioned earlier will be realized.\\nA. Employment and Income Situation\\nLet me first talk about the employment and income situation. As Japan's economy has continued its moderate expansion, the output gap -- which shows the utilization of labor and capital -- has remained positive. The Labour Force Survey-based number of employees has continued to increase, when smoothing out fluctuations, and the active job openings-to-applicants ratio has been at a high level that exceeds the peak marked during the bubble period. In addition, the unemployment rate has remained at a low level.\\nAmid the tight supply-demand conditions in the labor market, the year-on-year rate of increase in scheduled cash earnings of full-time employees has been in the range of around 0.5-1.0 percent. In addition, that in hourly scheduled cash earnings of part-time employees, which are responsive to supply-demand conditions in the labor market, has registered relatively high growth at around 2 percent. As a result, although total cash earnings per employee have risen moderately, albeit with fluctuations, the increases have remained relatively weak compared to tight labor market conditions, partly due to the high wage elasticity of labor supply in recent years, mainly among women and seniors.\\nAs Japan's economy is likely to continue on an expanding trend, it is expected that the supply-demand conditions in the labor market will remain tight. I therefore expect the rate of increase in total cash earnings per employee to gradually accelerate. However, there is a risk that firms will remain cautious with their decisions on wage setting, and in this context, I am paying close attention to developments in their stance regarding wages.\\nB. Prices\\nNext, I will turn to price developments, taking into account the employment and income situation. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) has remained at around 0.5 percent.\\nThe relatively weak price developments compared to the economic expansion and tight labor market conditions are attributed to the mindset and behavior based on the assumption that wages and prices will not increase easily. These mindset and behavior have been deeply entrenched among firms and households, due mainly to the experience of prolonged low growth and deflation. This will not change overnight, and it may in fact take a considerable amount of time. Also, firms have been making efforts to absorb the upward pressure of costs on prices by increasing labor-saving investment and streamlining their business process, and this has allowed firms to maintain their cautious stance toward raising prices.\\nMeanwhile, firms' moves to pass on increases in, for example, personnel expenses and distribution costs, to sales prices have been slowly spreading. Looking at annual price changes across all CPI items less fresh food, the share of price-increasing items minus that of price-decreasing items recently has been increasing moderately. This is a result of continued price rises in a wide range of items in response to rising personnel expenses and distribution costs.\\nWhile price developments are affected by a number of factors, I believe the underlying trend in prices is determined by the aggregate supply-demand balance. With the output gap remaining positive, it is projected that wage growth rates and the tolerance of households toward price rises will improve, and that firms' stance will shift toward further raising prices. In this situation, firms' moves to raise prices are likely to become more widespread. The actual rise in wages and prices is then expected to gradually weaken the mindset and behavior based on the assumption that wages and prices will not increase easily. Medium- to long-term inflation expectations are projected to rise gradually as a result. I therefore consider that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target of 2 percent has been maintained. However, attention should be paid to the possibility that such momentum will be lost as downside risks regarding the global economy are significant.\\nIII. Conduct of Monetary Policy\\nLet me now turn to the Bank's monetary policy.\\nThe Bank has set the price stability target at 2 percent in terms of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI and has been conducting monetary policy to achieve this target at the earliest possible time, under the framework of Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control. Under this framework, the Bank has been conducting yield curve control, in which it controls short- and long-term interest rates. Specifically, according to the guideline for market operations, the Bank currently sets the short-term policy interest rate at minus 0.1 percent and purchases Japanese government bonds (JGBs) so that 10-year JGB yields will remain at around 0 percent. With a view to lowering risk premia of asset prices, the Bank also purchases assets such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\\nI consider that the highly accommodative financial conditions, brought about by powerful monetary easing, have stimulated the spending activities of firms and households, and have contributed significantly to the positive output gap. Given the current situation where prices and inflation expectations have remained sluggish, I think that it is important to sustain the momentum toward achieving the price stability target through maintaining a positive output gap for as long as possible by keeping interest rates at sufficiently low levels for a prolonged time.\\nI also believe that any possible loss in momentum toward achieving the price stability target needs to be preempted. To further clarify the Bank's stance on monetary policy conduct in the current situation where downside risks to economic activity and prices are significant, the Bank stated at the Monetary Policy Meeting (MPM) held in July 2019, that it \"will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if there is a greater possibility that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target will be lost.\" There are various possible measures for additional easing, such as cutting the short-term policy interest rate, lowering the target level of 10-year JGB yields, expanding asset purchases, and accelerating the expansion of the monetary base. Given that, recently, slowdowns in overseas economies have continued to be observed and their downside risks seem to be increasing, it is becoming necessary to pay closer attention to the possibility that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target will be lost. While taking this situation into account, the Bank will reexamine economic and price developments at the next MPM in October.\\nIV. Challenges for Japan's Economy\\nI would now like to express my opinions regarding Japan's current economic situation from a longer-term perspective.\\nAccording to the Bank's estimates, the potential growth rate has been in the range of 0.5-1.0 percent recently. Although the rate has risen compared to around 2010, it can be said that Japan's growth potential has been sluggish of late. This is also an indication of the various challenges that Japan faces in achieving a rise in productivity. For example, it is difficult in Japan to establish business models through which firms can benefit from economies of scale, and where cost efficiency improves along with an expansion of business size. Although Japan's economy is the world's third largest, it is far smaller than that of the United States or China, and smaller also than that of the EU taken as a whole. Let me note that the rise of Chinese firms is backed by a rapid expansion of the Chinese economy. I think that the sluggish improvement in productivity among Japanese firms in recent years is partly attributable to the economic situation in Japan that I just outlined.\\nCross-border mergers and acquisitions undertaken by Japanese firms recently can be considered as one of the initiatives addressing the challenges. However, managing foreign firms is a new experience for many Japanese firms, and is likely to be quite difficult as there are a number of issues to be tackled, such as securing managers and adapting to different corporate cultures. Recent protectionist moves could also become an obstacle to the free mobility of labor, goods, money, and information. Since Japan's domestic market is small, I think that the business environment is becoming increasingly severe for Japanese firms.\\nDespite these trends, I see the potential growth rate rising through improvements in productivity as a wide range of entities continue to introduce structural reforms and implement growth strategies. With the output gap remaining positive, firms have continued to undertake labor-saving investment, mainly through the use of information technology. Furthermore, they have proceeded with working-style reforms and other initiatives that reflect demographic changes and the considerably tight labor market conditions. Steady progress has also been made in achieving diversity in the labor force, through the hiring of women, seniors, and foreign workers. As managers and workers have become aware of the need for greater efficiency and productivity, an increasing number of firms have been working to this end, not only in manufacturing, but also mainly in the administrative field, where robotic process automation (RPA) has been introduced. There is still significant room for improvement, mainly in the use of human resources and the enhancement of business efficiency, and I think we can expect a further rise in productivity through such initiatives.\\nAlthough these structural reforms and growth strategies may exert downward pressure on wages in the short term, I believe that they will play a role in underpinning the virtuous cycle from income to spending in the long term. Specifically, rising productivity will act as the starting point of such a cycle, stimulating price rises through increased wages and private consumption. Let me note, however, that raising productivity and growth potential does not occur overnight. It is therefore important to ensure a sustained virtuous cycle, in which increased demand encourages progress in various initiatives, as the Bank's monetary policy stimulates aggregate demand and reasonably tight supply-demand conditions are maintained. Thus, to achieve its price stability target and realize sustainable economic growth in a coordinated manner, the Bank should persistently continue with its powerful monetary easing and firmly support the initiatives of a wide range of entities."

        "title": "Mario Draghi: Policymaking, responsibility and uncertainty",
        "content": "In a few weeks, I will come to the end of my term as President of the European Central Bank. Such occasions provide an opportunity to look beyond the cut and thrust of current events and to reflect on the past, trusting that the experiences we have had and the lessons we have learned, may be useful for others.\\nIn this vein, I will not focus strictly on monetary policy or the business of central banking, but I would like instead to share my thoughts on the nature of policy responsibility. In various roles, I have had the privilege of having a policy mandate conferred upon me by elected politicians: here in Italy, at the Treasury and the Banca d'Italia; at the European level, at the ECB and as President of the European Financial Committee; and at the global level, as Chair of the Financial Stability Board.\\nI have had the good fortune to work with exceptional central bankers, public officials and political figures, people whose example I have learned from and to whom I owe a debt of gratitude. In turn, I hope that some of the lessons I have learned along the way may also be of benefit to the next generation of public servants.\\nMany students from this university, and from other places of learning, will at some point in their lives take up the mantle of public service. Society depends on its best young minds to devote their energies in the public interest.\\nToday, I would like to focus on three qualities that often appear to inform what we think of as good decision-making: knowledge, courage and humility.\\nOf course, these qualities do not guarantee that the right decision will always be made. Policymakers often take decisions in an environment of uncertainty, where outcomes are rarely known and cannot easily be anticipated. But as former United States Secretary of the Treasury, Robert Rubin, observed a few years ago, \"almost all significant issues are enormously complex [-] the very nature of reality is complexity and ambiguity\".1\\nKnowledge\\nSince policymakers face substantial uncertainty, they should strive to base their decisions on expert knowledge. This is crucial for acquiring a deep understanding of a subject, making informed decisions in a way that distinguishes the technical from the political and adjusting those decisions in the light of new evidence. Policymakers can never benefit from the same degree of empiricism as scientists, but they can employ the same approach of examining the evidence and testing hypotheses in order to better meet the demands that people place on government.\\nToday, however, we are living in a world where the salience of knowledge in policymaking is being challenged. Trust in objective facts, born of research and provided by impartial sources, is diminishing, to be replaced by subjectivity and the fragmentation of opinions into echo chambers.\\nIn this setting, it would be easy for policymakers to mirror what they believe to be the public mood: to turn away from expertise and adopt more partial perspectives, and to follow instinct rather than reason. But this does not typically serve the public interest.\\nHistory teaches us that when decisions are intended to have a lasting and positive impact, they are based on thorough research, accurately established facts and long experience. To give just one example, the creation of the Bretton Woods system - which stabilised the global economy after the war, served it well for decades and established the financial institutions that today are so critical for managing the consequences of globalisation - would not have been possible without the painstaking empirical analysis conducted during the war by the great economist Ragnar Nurske2 or the experience and vision of John Maynard Keynes.\\nExpertise is indispensable in that it allows us to grasp the complexity of our economies and societies; it allows us to quantify the risks associated with a particular set of circumstances, and thus judge the imperative to act; and it allows us to calculate the trade-offs and distributional effects of a particular action, and thus determine who benefits and who is adversely affected.\\nI believe this is important in every area of policy, but a particularly strong example is climate change. It is only through the expertise of climate scientists that we can understand the range of scenarios we face and the potential feedback loops between ecosystems; that we can quantify the tail risks and costs of inaction, as the late economist Martin Weitzman so brilliantly showed3; and that we can predict which regions and industries will be most affected (such as farmers in Italy and many other countries, who could be exposed to weather events that are increasingly difficult to cope with).4\\nNot unlike the ecological crisis, the euro area crisis has uncovered multiple feedback loops that were previously not well understood, for instance between sovereigns, banks and firms. It has challenged our understanding of key relationships in the economy, such as between unemployment and inflation. The ECB's assessment has always relied on accurate research and analysis by economists and statisticians. On several occasions, this approach has been essential for accurately framing the problem and providing the coordinates for an effective response.\\nOne example of this was the unprecedented policy package, including negative interest rates and purchases of government bonds, that the ECB adopted from 2014 to 2015 to prevent the euro area's imminent slide into deflation. At that time, many policymakers, myself included, had questions about how this would work in the euro area. Interest rates had never gone below zero in a major economy, and we did not know how purchasing government bonds would play out in our bank-based economy. These measures represented uncharted waters in which, by definition, the effects of our actions could not be known with certainty.\\nNevertheless, these decisions were guided by the evidence available to us, and by an assessment of the overall balance of risks and the options available to respond to them. The evidence at that time pointed in one direction: without new unconventional measures, the ECB would not be able to fulfil its price stability mandate. Analysis suggested that the effective bound on interest rates was lower than previously thought and that sovereign purchases could have a substantial impact via banks, because they would reduce financing costs for banks, and encourage them to lend to the real economy rather than invest in sovereign bonds.\\nThe latest estimates bear this out. The policy package is found to have had a substantial impact, contributing 2.7 percentage points to euro area real GDP growth between 2015 and 2018 and 1.3 percentage points to inflation. At least one-fifth of the overall impact on growth in the year that it peaked - 2017 - is attributable to negative rates, with asset purchases accounting for most of the remainder.5\\nOur assessment of these measures also included possible side effects. All monetary policies have side effects, even in normal times, and impact on some groups more than others. But as the central bank for the euro area as a whole, the ECB is tasked with looking at the overall picture: whether the benefits of the policy measures taken, in net terms, outweigh the potential costs.\\nThe data suggested, and continue to suggest, that this is the case - a conclusion shared by the central banking community globally, as a recent report from the Bank for International Settlements shows.6 However, as with all evidence-based policymaking, conclusions must be continuously reviewed and updated as necessary.\\nIt was with this in mind that the ECB recently made adjustments to negative rates, introducing tiering for excess reserves. On another occasion, a detailed evidence-based analysis showed that concerns that unconventional policies worsen inequality were unfounded,7 and this strengthened the ECB's resolve to pursue its policy path.\\nThis is not to say that experts - the ECB included - have perfect knowledge. Theories can have blind spots and forecasts can be proven wrong. The crisis revealed that the conviction then prevailing among economists that financial markets could largely self-regulate was misplaced. Indeed, as Robert Shiller has explained, both the public and experts can fall victim to \"narrative epidemics\" which can have an adverse impact on the economy.8 \\nThe answer to this, however, is not to reject the value of knowledge. It is for those with expert knowledge to continuously re-examine the evidence, scrutinise their prior assumptions and listen to dissenting voices. Policymakers depend on dissent to hold a mirror up to their actions and to break the power of dominant narratives. This is vital to the advancement of knowledge and is the foundation of all scientific progress.\\nFor those tasked with making decisions, nothing can replace rigorous analysis accompanied by experience.\\nCourage\\nKnowledge can only go so far, however. Once the facts have been established as best they can, then comes the decision to act. And in economic policy, as with other policy, all actions have side effects and unintended consequences. There are situations in which even the best analysis does not provide enough certainty to render making a decision easy; it is often tempting not to make a decision at all. But this is precisely the point at which policymakers must draw on the second quality: courage.\\nFor inaction is also a decision. When the effect of inaction would be to compromise the mandate conferred on the policymaker by the legislator, the decision not to act is a decision to fail. There are many instances when policymakers are compelled to act knowing that the consequences of their decisions are uncertain. But they do so in the confidence that doing nothing would lead to an outcome considerably worse and cause them to betray their mandate.\\nOver the past decade of crisis, the need to take decisions, even critical ones, often faced three hurdles: fear that not all potential complications had been considered, opposition from vested interests and doubts about the legitimacy to act.\\nInaction based on fear of complications is rooted in the belief that there is no need to change existing arrangements, even when all evidence and analysis point to the need to act. But this complacency is motivated by arguments that often find no support in reality.\\nThe setting-up of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), the launch of European banking supervision, the creation of the Single Resolution Fund - all faced opposition on grounds of concerns regarding moral hazard or the appropriate allocation to the European level of competencies previously performed at national levels. In retrospect, euro area governments did not lack courage and they took the key steps at crucial moments. Our monetary union is stronger today as a result, and most of the predicted complications did not come to pass.\\nHowever, the main point here is not that these decisions were validated in hindsight, but that, once the need to take action had been substantiated and justified, the courage was found to take decisions, without hesitation, for the benefit of Economic and Monetary Union.\\nThe second hurdle that policymakers have often faced when implementing reforms is the opposition from vested interests. In particular, it was clear at the onset of the crisis that several governments needed to enact structural reforms to improve growth prospects and lower unemployment. But structural reforms always create winners and losers, and governments met inevitable resistance from those set to lose out.\\nThese governments, however, were able to separate vested interests from the public interest, recognising that many more stood to gain from action - and the benefits are now largely there to see. Focusing on the labour market alone, there is evidence that countries that implemented reforms directly after the crisis have seen both cyclical and structural unemployment go down. These reforms have also made employment growth more responsive to GDP growth, which has contributed to the 11 million increase in jobs that we have seen in the euro area since mid-2013 as the economy has recovered.9\\nThe third hurdle concerns doubts about the legitimacy to act. This is something that the ECB has faced with several of its unconventional policies, not least its Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) programme that was launched in the summer of 2012. Initially, there was considerable opposition to OMT in some quarters on the grounds that it was not the central bank's job to stabilise the euro area, but rather that of politicians, and that doing so would cross the line into fiscal policy.\\nOn the one hand, there was a concern that a commitment to unlimited bond purchases could cross the dividing line between monetary policy and other policies. However, this was more a question of design than of principle. What was needed was to create safeguards and limits to contain such risks, which we achieved with, among other things, the requirement for an ESM programme to guarantee sound economic policies. The European Court of Justice has since confirmed that the design of OMT was fully in line with the ECB's mandate.\\nSet against this was the material risk - had we failed to act decisively - of a catastrophic unravelling of the euro area with severe deflationary consequences. By July 2012 spreads vis-\\xe0-vis German ten-year government bonds had reached 5% in Italy and 6% in Spain, with even wider spreads in Greece, Portugal and Ireland. The cost of deflation protection had risen from 184 basis points in January 2012 to 276 basis points in July.\\nSo, what gave us the courage to act was the conviction that there was a far greater risk if we did nothing. Inaction would have meant nothing less than the failure of our mandate and, potentially, of the currency we had been tasked with preserving. This reality made the course taken inescapable - meaning it was the only viable option for any responsible policymaker.\\nWhile OMT was never activated, the effect of our commitment to do what was necessary to preserve the euro was profound, and equivalent to that of a large-scale asset purchase programme: spreads in vulnerable countries fell on average by more than 4% over the next two years. The macroeconomic impact of OMT was also analogous to purchase programmes carried out in other countries. In fact, ECB research finds that the GDP and price effects of OMT were broadly in line with those estimated for the quantitative easing that took place in the United States and the United Kingdom.10\\nHumility\\nThe third quality, humility, comes from the recognition that the power and responsibility held by public servants are not boundless, but are derived from the mandate conferred on them which provides the guidance for decision-making and sets the limits of action.\\nPublic servants, and central bankers in particular, have a political mandate, in that the mandate is bestowed on them through a political process. ECB Board members are appointed by the Chamber of States - the EU Council - and a view is expressed on those appointments by representatives of the people: the European Parliament. They are bound by an objective -price stability - which in Europe has constitutional value: it is enshrined in the Treaty. Elsewhere this is embedded in law, but in each case it emanates from a democratic process. And they are fully accountable to parliaments.\\nThis political mandate is essential for central bank independence to be compatible with democracy. Central banks are powerful, independent and unelected, and this combination can only be squared if they have a clearly defined mandate which is conferred by elected representatives and for which they are held accountable by the public. For our part, the ECB President is called on to testify every three months before the European Parliament, which in my case came to a total of forty meetings in eight years, and I have also appeared before parliamentary committees in many national parliaments to clarify our actions and answer questions.\\nThe political nature of our mandate has significant implications. It means that we are not at liberty to decide whether we should do what is necessary to deliver it. It is our duty to do so. Accepting failure is not an option when there are tools available for public servants to fulfil their mandates. At the same time, our mandates constitute a binding obligation: we must always operate strictly within the law. No responsible policymaker can ever conceive of acting ultra vires.\\nEverything the ECB has done during the crisis has been guided by this principle, and a particularly telling example is the situation we faced in mid-2015 with respect to Greece.\\nAt that time, we faced two sets of diametrically opposed opinions. One was that we should cut Greece off from central bank financing, which would have implied the full collapse of the Greek economy and the likely exit of Greece from the euro area. The other view was that we should provide unlimited, unconditional liquidity to the Greek government and the Greek economy no matter what. The former option would have meant the ECB triggering events of momentous political importance with potential implications for its mandate - the type of decision, moreover, that falls within the jurisdiction of elected authorities. The latter option, however, would have meant potentially engaging in monetary financing or funding banks without adequate collateral, thereby violating the Treaty.\\nSo, we pursued a path that fulfilled our mandate, thereby remaining strictly within the confines of the law. The support given to Greece was substantial: at its peak, the combined lending of the ECB and the Bank of Greece to Greek banks reached \\u20ac127 billion, or 71% of the country's GDP. But it was never unconditional and it was never unlimited. Participation in an adjustment programme agreed with the Eurogroup guaranteed the quality of the collateral being put forward by Greek banks to secure their funding, in the form of government bonds. Various safeguards also prevented any monetary financing of the State. The ECB stayed within the confines of its mandate.\\nUltimately, it was an approach that worked for both Greece and Europe, although the price paid by the Greek people was high. European solidarity, combined with the true courage and commitment of successive Greek governments, meant that a way was found to get through the crisis.\\nSince we were always extremely mindful of the scope and confines of our legal obligations, we were not concerned that some of our decisions were challenged in the European Court of Justice. On the contrary, it was welcome, because it allowed one of the highest legal authorities to verify the full legality of our actions, and to clarify what the ECB could and could not do. The Court not only affirmed that asset purchases are a legal instrument of monetary policy in the euro area, but emphasised the broad discretion of the ECB in using all our tools in a necessary and proportionate way to achieve our objective. I have described our position as the obligation to \"do everything it takes, [-] within our mandate, and to achieve our mandate\".11\\nBut understanding the scope and confines of our mandate imparts another obligation: to speak up when necessary and explain the available options. This is what is needed today.\\nI once described central bank independence as \"independence in interdependence\".12 What I meant is that the institutional context in which we operate affects the speed at which we can achieve our objective, and the scale of the side effects of our actions. There is a need to say clearly when other policy areas could help us to do our job more quickly and effectively.\\nCentral bank independence is not an end in itself. Its purpose is to ensure that the central bank is credible in its pursuit of price stability, while making sure that monetary policy is never subservient to fiscal policy - what is known as \"monetary dominance\". Thus central bank independence does not preclude communication with governments when it is clear that mutually aligned policies would deliver a faster return to price stability. It only imposes limits on what such alignment could entail. Specifically, it means that alignment between policies, where needed, must serve the objective of monetary stability and should not work to the detriment of it.\\nThis is why, since 2014, we have gradually placed more emphasis on the macroeconomic policy mix in the euro area, which is the respective contribution of monetary and fiscal policy in supporting the economy. We have seen in other regions where fiscal policy has played a greater role since the crisis that the return to price stability has been faster. In the United States, for example, from 2009 to 2018 the average cyclically adjusted government primary balance13 was -3.6%, while it was 0.5% for the euro area.\\nThis is one of the reasons that interest rates in the United States have been able to rise sooner, while in the euro area they have been low or negative for a long time. A more active fiscal policy in the euro area would thus make it possible to adjust our policies more quickly, which we are well aware are having adverse effects on certain sectors of society and certain intermediaries.\\nIt is always with this idea of \"independence in interdependence\" in mind that, throughout my mandate, the ECB has continuously advocated further institutional reform of the euro area. We have welcomed the improvements that have been made and urged governments and parliaments to continue working towards that goal. We have done so because we know that it is only by taking these steps that we can make our monetary union more resilient - and more able to deliver on the expectations for which it was created in the first place.\\nConclusion\\nAllow me to conclude.\\nAs I said in my introduction, I hope that many students from this university will one day choose to put their skills and energy to use in serving the public. If you elect to do so, I have no doubt that you will encounter considerable challenges, as all policymakers do. There will be setbacks and mistakes, because the world is complex. But I hope that you may find encouragement in the fact that, throughout history, decisions based on knowledge, courage and humility have always proven their value.\\nThe establishment of the European Union, the introduction of the euro and the operations of the ECB have encountered many obstacles and faced many critics. And yet they have proven their worth, and it is now the \"doubters\" that are being doubted. This is part of the normal evolution of monetary unions, which is slow, non-linear and bumpy. The United States, for example, did not even have a central bank until more than 130 years after its establishment, while its federal budget only developed meaningfully in the 1930s. Today, few would consider winding back the clock.\\nWhat is important for a monetary union to evolve is that its citizens believe in but also contest the union, rather than seeing the world through a local lens. We saw this emerging in the most recent European Parliament election, which was perhaps the first such election fought mainly on European questions. Even those who were seeking to slow down European integration did so by contesting the EU institutions rather than rejecting their legitimacy outright. In the end, the European public elected a pro-European majority.\\nFor this reason, I am optimistic about the future of Europe, because I believe that, over time, being a part of the EU and the euro area have, for most people, become the norm. The euro is more popular than it ever has been, while support for the EU also stands at its highest level since the crisis. Debates and critiques about the future of Europe are now less about whether it should exist, and more about how best to take it forward. That is a solid basis for our union to endure and, ultimately, to thrive.\\n1 Rubin, R.E., \"In an Uncertain World: Tough Choices from Wall Street to Washington\", 2004.\\n2 See Eichengreen, B., \"Ragnar Nurkse and the international financial architecture\", Baltic Journal of Economics, Vol. 18, No 2, July 2018, pp. 118-128.\\n3 Weitzman, M.L., \"A Review of The Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change\", Journal of Economic Literature, Vol. XLV, September 2017, pp. 703-724.\\n4 Bozzola, M., Massetti, E., Mendelsohn, R. and Capitanio, F. \"A Ricardian analysis of the impact of climate change on Italian agriculture\", European Review of Agricultural Economics, Vol. 45, No 1, February 2018, pp. 57-79.\\n5 Rostagno, M., Altavilla, C., Carboni, G., Lemke, W., Motto, R., Saint-Guilhem, A. and Yiangou, J., \"A tale of two decades: The ECB's monetary policy at 20\", 2019, forthcoming.\\n6 Bank for International Settlements, \"Unconventional monetary policy tools: a cross-country analysis\", CGFS Papers, No 63, October 2019.\\n7 See Lenza, M. and Slacelek J., \"How does monetary policy affect income and wealth inequality?

        "title": "Luis de Guindos: Gabriel Zucman's contribution to research on wealth inequality and the redistributive effects on globalization",
        "content": "It is a pleasure for me to celebrate with you the award of the 2019 Bern\\xe1cer Prize to Gabriel Zucman, Assistant Professor of Economics at the University of California, Berkeley. Gabriel's creative work on measuring household wealth over time and across countries and his studies on the effects of taxation and globalisation on the accumulation of wealth have become increasingly influential among academic economists and policymakers. He is a deserved recipient of the Bern\\xe1cer Prize, which is awarded each year to an outstanding young European economist working in the fields of macroeconomics and finance.\\nThis year's prize has been awarded specifically for Gabriel's \"influential research on wealth inequality and the redistributive effects of globalisation\". Gabriel, together with his co-authors Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez, has been one of the pioneers in this field, showing us how to use various data sources - aggregate sectoral accounts, household surveys, fiscal data, historical administrative data and unofficial records - to estimate the evolution and determinants of the wealth distribution over centuries. Such a long time range is important, as many of the movements in wealth inequality are very gradual, which means that these changes can only be estimated reliably once enough data are available. At the same time, retrieving historical information on wealth poses multiple challenges. First, data on household wealth are much scarcer than, say, data on household income. Second, the wealth distribution is heavily skewed toward its top tail, such that relatively few households hold a large fraction of aggregate wealth in the economy. Consequently, to be able to measure wealth inequality, it is important that we include information about the very richest households. Third, and especially for the richest households, one should account for all assets, including those held abroad, which tend to be more difficult to trace.\\nA key approach used by Gabriel to overcome these challenges is the \"income capitalisation method\", which uses fiscal data on capital income to estimate the wealth distribution. Although not always easily accessible, fiscal data are available for several decades and also cover the richest households. The method is therefore useful in estimating the evolution of the wealth distribution over long periods of time. Using this approach, Gabriel has provided us with estimates of the top wealth shares in the United States over the last century.1 This influential work shows that wealth concentration in the United States was high at the beginning of the 20th century, fell from 1929 to 1978, and has continuously increased since then. The substantial increase in wealth inequality since the early 1980s has been driven by the very richest households (the top 0.1% of the wealth distribution and above).\\nGabriel then used the estimates of the wealth distribution to construct \"distributional national accounts\" for the United States.2 These accounts combine tax, survey and national accounts data to estimate the distribution of national income across households. Importantly, in contrast to previous estimates which only capture the income recorded in aggregate statistics in an incomplete fashion, distributional national accounts consistently cover all national income in aggregate data. In addition, this work provides estimates for both pre-tax and after-tax income, documenting the extent to which the tax system has dampened the increase in US income inequality over the past few decades.\\nGabriel's findings for the United States have recently been extended to many other countries, including large emerging economies, in the \"World Inequality Database\", which provides data on household inequality calculated using a common and consistent methodology. The time series in the World Inequality Database are the result of an ingenious combination of various data sources, including survey data, tax data and, sometimes, information from named lists of wealthy individuals to improve estimates of the very top of the wealth distribution.\\nThe World Inequality Database has substantially benefited the academic community by providing easily accessible data, and it has spurred a wider debate about the causes and consequences of inequality. For example, the database has documented diverse trends in the dynamics of income and wealth inequality since 1980 across countries, suggesting national institutions play a key role in affecting inequality. The data show that in recent decades incomes of the poorer half of the global population grew significantly thanks to high growth in Asia, in particular in China and India.\\nGabriel's extensive work measuring the distribution of wealth and income has allowed us to think more rigorously and in quantitative terms about the main determinants of changes in household wealth distribution.\\nAt this point, allow me to stress that this topic is especially important in the euro area, where the public debate on the expansionary stance of monetary policy is sometimes caricatured in terms of a clash between \"winning\" borrowers and \"losing\" savers. This representation is simplistic because it ignores the various other channels through which monetary policy affects household wealth, including its indirect impact on incomes and employment. In fact, new approaches to modelling and analysing household heterogeneity have recently stressed the importance of these indirect channels of monetary transmission, which operate through the responses of higher wages and employment to monetary easing.3 A key quantitative finding of that literature is that this indirect income channel disproportionately stimulates incomes and consumption in the lower part of the distribution.\\nIn line with this work, internal ECB research finds that low short rates do hurt \"savers\", i.e., households owning non negligible amounts of liquid assets, via a direct effect - that is, via the reduction in their income from those assets. Low short rates, however, also benefit savers, like all other households, via an indirect effect - that is, the reduction in their unemployment rate and the increase in their labour income. The indirect effect dominates from a quantitative perspective. In addition, through the reduction of the unemployment rate of poorer households, the indirect effect reduced income inequality. On the whole, these results support the finding that monetary policy in recent years benefited most households and did not contribute to an increase in wealth, income or consumption inequality.4 This debate illustrates that we need increasingly precise ways to measure wealth in order to foster a more informed public debate about the effects of various policies and other factors on the distribution of wealth. As you may know, the Eurosystem has for many years contributed to the measurement and analysis of the wealth distribution and its components across countries by collecting and providing the Household Finance and Consumption Survey micro data.\\nMy overview of Gabriel's work has been quite selective, focusing on topics related to the measurement and determinants of inequality in household wealth, but Gabriel has also worked on an impressive range of other areas, such as the substitution between illegal tax evasion and legal tax avoidance, effects of wealth taxes on household saving and the role of tax havens and tax competition in profit-shifting by large multinational firms.\\nDedicated research to measure inequality around the globe and the analysis of its root causes is an established priority among major institutions. This is an important development. We should however not lose focus. Despite impressive progress in combating poverty over the past decades, poverty persists at unacceptable levels.\\nThat's why, in face of a global economic slowdown, economic policy needs to ensure that people continue to move out of poverty in the years to come.\\nPlease join me in congratulating Gabriel on being awarded this year's Bern\\xe1cer Prize. Gabriel, I wish you continued success and look forward to following your future work.\\n1 Saez, E. and Zucman, G.

        "title": "Gent Sejko: A brave new world? The future of banking in emerging Europe",
        "content": "Your Excellency Mr President,\\nHonourable Madam Minister and Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee,\\nDear representatives of the banking system, ladies and gentlemen, dear guests,\\nIt gives me great pleasure to welcome you on behalf of the Bank of Albania to our Annual Conference. This year the conference is co-organised again with the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), namely its Institute of Global Affairs - internationally renowned for its leading expertise across the social sciences.\\nThe Conference this year will seek to address the latest trends in the banking industry in Albania, in the region and the rest of the world, focusing on challenges and opportunities that lie ahead of us.\\nNaturally, these issues are of great interest not only to actors in the banking market but also to central banks and other regulators of the financial market. As we share experiences and engage in open discussions, we will be able to identify far-reaching approaches that are best fitted to meet the challenges ahead. We have invited distinguished speakers and experts from renowned international institutions as well as other actors and regulators from Albania and the region.\\nI am confident the conference will live up to its reputation.\\nDear Ladies and Gentlemen,\\nThe financial system and the banking sector at the heart of it play a unique role for economic development and welfare in Albania.\\nThis system provides payment instruments, contributing to the free circulation of products and services. It also offers savings and credit instruments for households and enterprises, promoting therefore development and enhancing welfare. The financial system helps households, enterprises and the economy to withstand shocks, by undertaking risks on its balance sheets and offering products to insure life, business activities and against natural disasters.\\nTherefore, the efficiency, stability and sophistication of the financial system are essential preconditions for rapid, stable and comprehensive growth. The development level of an economy is inter-related and inter-dependent on the development level of its financial system. This has been extensively illustrated by the Albanian experience over the last three decades.\\nThe progress marked in the first decade of transition was conditioned by, among other things, embryonic developments in the banking and financial sectors. In the second decade, the activity of the banking sector expanded and competitiveness in this sector increased, setting the stage for crediting and economic growth to gather speed. This performance was disrupted by the global financial crisis effects spilled over to Albanian economy. However, unlike in many countries of the region, the crisis did not trigger recession or a proper financial crisis in Albania. Yet, indirect effects were present both in the economy and in the financial system.\\nAs a monetary, supervisory and regulatory authority of the banking sector, in recent years, the Bank of Albania has focused on addressing challenges introduced by the crisis. \\nLet me present a brief overview.\\nFirst, due to aggregate demand slowdown and exchange rate depreciation, the financial situation of households and enterprises worsened; hence non-performing loans rose rapidly and credit supply contracted. Among other things, the rise in non-performing loans pointed to the need for comprehensive improvement of the legal and regulatory environment, especially with regard to the execution of collateral. Against this backdrop, in cooperation with other public agencies, the Bank of Albania compiled and implemented a detailed programme of measures, which addressed thoroughly the identified inadequacies. As a result, the level of non-performing loans dropped rapidly and credit supply improved. This action also created adequate conditions for its growth to gradually pick up the pace. \\nSecond, following the introduction of stricter regulatory requirements on banking activity in the European Union, foreign banks reduced their exposure to both regional economies and Albania. Known also as deleveraging, this effect showed that higher integration of the banking sector exposes us to monetary policies and regulatory requirements applied in home countries. In response, the Bank of Albania has worked towards aligning our domestic supervisory and regulatory framework with European Union standards. We have implemented, in this regard, a new macro-prudential strategy, after the model of the European System of Central Banks. We have also carried out a comprehensive review of the supervisory and regulatory frameworks, to better address the risks to the banking sector: operational risk, market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. Finally, we have actively participated in an international forum for addressing this phenomenon, known as the Vienna Initiative, and have enhanced our communication with international partners and home-country regulatory agencies.\\nThird, we have spent a lot of time and energy administering a consolidation process in the banking sector. As a result of this process, which may now be considered as finalised, the number of banks has now been reduced to 12. This has created the premises for the banking sector to be more motivated to lend, innovative in terms of products, and more competitive in terms of cost.\\nFrom a broader perspective, the Bank of Albania has worked on improving the regulatory architecture of the financial system in Albania and strengthening financial safety nets. Together with other public agencies, we have, established the Financial Stability Advisory Group; improved the legal framework for the functioning of the Deposit Insurance Agency; approved the Resolution Law; drafted a sub-legal and regulatory framework; and, established the necessary structures for them to function.\\nIn parallel, we have adopted a modern framework for formulating and implementing the monetary policy, and steadily maintained an accommodative stance. Monetary stimulus has enabled the financial environment in Albania to be transparent, and have low interest rates, ample liquidity and moderate exchange rate fluctuations. This has boosted consumption and private investments, reduced credit price, and eased debt servicing costs for all segments of the economy.\\nReflecting these actions, the Albanian economy has made notable progress towards steady and long-term growth. The progress has been characterised by gradual acceleration of the pace of growth, expansion of employment and decline in unemployment, as well as improvement of private sector balance sheets. In particular, the banking sector appears liquid, well capitalised, with good profitability indicators. Regulatory capital hovers around 18%, notably above the minimum requirement, whereas the ratio of non-performing loans has dropped to 11% against the 25% maximum level recorded in 2014.\\nDear ladies and gentlemen,\\nThe ultimate objective of our work has been and remains promoting sustainable development for the country. The philosophy of our work is built on four main pillars: professionalism, responsibility, accountability, and transparency.\\nThis philosophy has been tested and enriched with some valuable lessons learned during the last decade:\\nFirst, monetary, supervisory and regulatory authorities should adopt a proactive approach to the country's monetary and financial stability. This requires adequate institutional capacities and adopting a counter-cyclical approach, both toward monetary policy and macro-prudential policy. It also requires constantly identifying current and potential challenges in order to address them in due time.\\nSecond, long-term economic growth should be anchored in continuous structural reforms. Public authorities may find it virtually impossible to predict or avoid shocks completely; however, both public authorities and the private sector may minimise the effects of these shocks through structural reforms aimed at creating productive and flexible structures, and preserving balance sheet stability. Public authorities and the private sector should be aware of the fact that long-term benefits from reforms exceed their short-term costs.\\nThird, financial integration provides an additional channel of exposures to foreign shocks, whether in the form of global financial crisis or volatility in the regulatory framework. Overall, financial integration has been and remains a positive factor for development. In the case of Albania, it brings in financial capital and managerial know-how, with a series of positive effects on the Albanian economy, spearheading the economic and political integration of the country. Yet, integration requires fostering cooperation and exchanging information with our international partners and counterpart institutions.\\nLastly, the monetary and financial stability of the country should not be seen as an exclusive responsibility of the central bank, notwithstanding its primary role in it. It requires the contribution and cooperation of all state authorities.\\nDear ladies and gentlemen,\\nThe Albanian economy has solid premises for continuing and even accelerating the pace of growth. Strengthened financial stability, coupled with prudent monetary policies, offers additional guarantees for its sustainability.\\nHowever, let me point out that many challenges lie ahead of us.\\nFrom a broader perspective, the financial industry, both in our region and globally, is under pressure from four powerful currents:\\nRapid development of information technology, which has created opportunities for financial innovation and has challenged classical banking models. New payment and credit instruments, new financial market actors, and new business models, such as digital and electronic banking and payments, boost the penetration of financial services. Conversely, they challenge not only classical actors of the financial sector but also its regulators.\\nGlobalisation, which has expanded the scope of market actors and regulators. This phenomenon significantly exposes emerging economies to volatility in the regulatory framework or in the risk appetite in advanced economies.\\nRe-regulation, currently underway in the financial system in Europe and globally. This process is aimed at enhancing security in the banking sector, lowering the probability of systemic crisis, and enhancing the capacities of authorities for managing them. However, it imposes additional costs on the banking sector and places it under less favourable conditions vis-\\xe0-vis other market participants.\\nVery low interest rates that characterise many segments of the global financial market. These rates reflect the accommodative monetary policy stance adopted by major central banks, the decline in global productivity and unfavourable demographic developments in advanced economies. These have a toll on the balance sheets of broader segments of the financial market such as banking sector, pension funds and insurance companies.\\nFrom a nearer-term perspective, Albania needs to improve financial literacy, across the board. Among other things, financial education would help both individuals and firms establish sounder financial situations and reduce financial risks such as unnecessary exposure to exchange rate volatility. The Bank of Albania has been on the vanguard of financial education in Albania and will continue to spearhead such efforts.\\nAlbania needs also to develop further payment systems and improve access to finance for various segments of the society, such as small and medium-sized enterprises or the rural sector. The Bank of Albania has responsibly exercised its duties in the area of payment system development. In this regard, we:\\nEstablished, in 2015, the National Payments System Committee, to coordinate the work of all relevant public and private sector agencies;\\nCompiled the draft law \"On payments services\", which approximates the respective EU directive and paves the way for developing new payment products; and,\\nImproved the technological infrastructure for payments, reducing therefore their costs.\\nHowever, our work may not be considered as completely finished.\\nLastly, Albania should pay attention to the development of new financial market segments, such as capital markets and pension and investment funds. In this context, alignment of the legal and regulatory framework is of primary importance with a view to preventing the potential emergence of systemic risks or the possibility of regulatory arbitrage.\\n***\\nDear ladies and gentlemen,\\nOur agenda for the work that lies ahead of us is as complex as ambitious. Its successful realisation will enable our economy to grow at a fast and steady pace, and will mark a step forward in our journey towards EU integration.\\nOn behalf of the Bank of Albania, let me affirm our readiness to rise to the challenge. I am also confident that today's conference will provide a significant contribution to finding optimal solutions.\\nHoping that you will find the Conference and your stay in Tirana both valuable and enjoyable, I wish the conference a great success! Thank you for your attention!"

        "content": "Vivek (Pathak), ladies and gentlemen, good morning.\\nIt gives me great pleasure to welcome you to today's seminar on greening financial institutions.\\nThe effects of climate change are already visible around the world. In the past four decades, we have witnessed some of the warmest years on record, and the number of natural disasters has more than doubled.  In Asia, 50% of our urban population are living in low-lying coastal zones and flood plains.  The long-term effects of climate change will likely bring damages to our economies and businesses.\\nHong Kong sits along the coast and therefore climate change risk is particularly relevant to us. For instance, I believe banks in Hong Kong felt impacted by the Super Typhoon Mangkhut from last year.  Whereas properties close to the harbour used to be valued better, banks would now have more considerations on their valuations when granting mortgages.\\nUnder this setting, not only are the governments being compelled to act in the face of climate change, most notably under the 2015 Paris Agreement, there is also a growing consensus amongst central banks and financial regulators to take a more proactive stance against these risks.\\nFor example, the Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System, commonly known as the NGFS, in which over 40 central banks and supervisors have already reached a consensus: and I quote, \"climate-related risks are a source of financial risk and therefore fall squarely within the mandates of central banks and supervisors to ensure that the financial system is resilient to these risks.\" The HKMA is a member of NGFS, and we are fully on board with this\\nThe Bank for International Settlements is also committed to supporting green finance and investment practices, and supports the NGFS research on climate-related risks and their implications for financial stability.\\nThe HKMA has many roles - as a bank regulator, one of the largest asset owners globally, and a key promoter of market development. Hence, the HKMA is in a very advantageous position to promote green and sustainable finance in Hong Kong. In May this year, we unveiled three sets of measures on green finance:\\nThe first measure is a three-phased approach to promote Green and Sustainable Banking in Hong Kong. Initially, to develop a common framework to assess the existing baseline of individual banks to establish how \"green\" they are, by talking to the industry to identify the parameters to be included in the assessment; secondly, to engage and consult the industry on whether supervisory requirements are needed; and if needed, how the HKMA should develop our supervisory expectation or requirements; and thirdly to focus on implementation, monitoring and evaluation.\\nThe second measure relates to responsible investment by the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund now adopts a guiding principle that priority will be given to Green and ESG investments, if the long term return is comparable with other investments on a risk-adjusted basis.\\nOur third measure is the launch of the Centre for Green Finance under the HKMA's Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office, focusing on capacity building to facilitate the equipping of financial institutions with the knowledge, skills, tools and other resources in green finance.\\nIn fact, we're now in our developmental plan to prepare banks for the upcoming changes. A working group on the assessment framework has been in place since August, and today's seminar marks the beginning of the capacity building programme for the Centre for Green Finance. On the other hand, the assessment framework will help banks understand their readiness for change, while the capacity building events will equip practitioners with the necessary knowledge for the changes.\\nFor today's seminar, we will first invite the IFC to provide an overview of the opportunities and challenges to green banking, and introduce some case studies on their approach to assisting banks in \"greening\" their operations. This afternoon, several banks will share their initiatives and practical experience on their green journey, including governance, risk management, disclosure and green products and business policy.\\nAnd here I would like to extend our special thanks to the IFC for their dedicated support for this workshop. Their expertise will surely benefit our audience today.  I would also like to thank HSBC, Standard Chartered Bank, Citibank, BOC and BNP Paribas for sharing their experiences with everyone later today.\\nLadies and gentlemen, I wish you all a fruitful workshop and I look forward to working closely together with the industry to develop green and sustainable banking in Hong Kong. Thank you very much."

It is both inspiring and a privilege to be given the op-portunity to speak in more academic contexts, such as this one. Although it was a long time since I was conducting academic research myself, I try to keep updated on what is happening, not only because it is part of the job, but also for my own interest. Now, about ten years on from the global financial crisis, I feel that we are in an unusually interesting phase.\\nWorldwide economic events like the financial crisis, such as the Great Depression of the 1930s and stagflation in the 1970s, often have a profound effect on both macroeconomic thinking and practical policy. It is possible that something similar will also happen this time, but what a new macroeconomic paradigm will look like and what the policy implications will be is still unclear.\\nFor my part, the crisis that affected Sweden and a few other countries in the early 1990s is etched on my mind, not least because, back then, I headed the so-called Bank Support Committee, which managed problems in the Swedish banking sec-tor. That crisis did not perhaps have such a profound effect on macroeconomic thinking at the global level as it was a more local phenomenon than the latest fi-nancial crisis."

        "title": "Denis Beau: The role of cryptoassets in the payment system ",
        "content": "Ladies and gentlemen,\\nThe payment landscape is currently dominated by a bank-based ecosystem, an interchangeable use at par, of commercial bank and central bank money as settlement assets, and an anchor role for central bank money which is the sole settlement asset with legal tender status. It is certainly an understatement to say that this landscape may be significantly altered given technological developments and changes in consumer preferences underway. As these developments and changes unfold, both the \\xab front-end \\xbb arrangements that ensure the interaction between the payer or payee and the payment service provider, to initiate or receive payments, and the \\xab back-end \\xbb arrangements that transfer information and funds between the payer and the payee, will change. With the emergence of so called \\xab crypto-assets \\xbb like the bitcoin and so called \\xab stablecoins \\xbb, we may also see new settlement assets develop which may compete against and possibly, according to their promoters, replace commercial and central bank money as settlement assets at the center of our payment systems.\\nFor the time being, in spite of their rapidly growing number and variety, crypto-assets only account for a marginal share of assets held by economic agents. In October 2019, according to CoinMarketCap, total outstanding crypto-assets represented EUR 205 billion globally; in comparison, the euro area's M3 monetary aggregate amounted to EUR 12.5 trillion in August 2019.\\nIn addition, the diversity of views on the contributions that crypto-assets can make to the efficiency and safety of our payment systems mirrors the one in their forms. Some see crypto-assets as a disruptive innovation poised to radically change the way our monetary and financial system operates, and changing it for the better. Others believe that for the time being they do not provide a new and attractive answer to the classical trilemma payments solutions face between low cost, high execution speed and low risk, and would change the way our monetary and financial system operates for the worse.\\nTo share with you a few thoughts on this debate, speaking from the perspective of a central banker and a supervisor mindful of the benefit of innovations but also of the risks they could bring to financial and monetary stability, I will focus my remarks on:\\n1- whether and how crypto-assets can contribute to improve our payment systems,\\n2- the public policy challenges they raise, in particular for central banks, and how to address them.\\nI - Crypto-assets and the future of payment systems\\n1- In the payment instrument landscape, there is currently a twin trend: the share of cash payments dwindles while cashless payments undergo a transformation driven by behavioral changes and technological innovation. Shifts in consumption patterns, such as the growth of e-commerce, are fueling a steady decline in the use of cash in transactions, while the use of electronic payment instruments and systems is increasing, rooted in the current surge in global digitalization, along with the development of internet-based technologies and multi-functional technological devices.\\nHowever, the decline of cash payments needs to be put into context because, if the downwards trend is undisputable - the volume of banknotes returned by the public to cash processing firms fell by over 10% between 2012 and 2017, -banknotes still dominate face-to-face transactions- particularly small-value ones. Banknotes remain the main payment instrument in Europe by number of transactions, accounting for 79% of the latter in the euro area and 68% in France (54% and 28% respectively in value).\\nThe increase in the use of electronic payment instruments and systems is developing along four different pathways.\\nFirst, the sophistication of internet technologies and devices for transactions: the number of channels used to initiate and accept payments has increased significantly. Contactless payments and mobile payments are some examples.\\nSecond, the availability of payment services at any time: payment services are becoming more available, ignoring physical borders and time constraints to satisfy customer demand for instant, continuous and uniform payment services, as economic agents become ever more mobile. Instant payments in Europe are for example designed to be executed in less than 15 seconds compared to the duration of 24H to 48H for traditional payment orders. This improvement in the functioning of payment systems represents a huge step for liquidity circulation.\\nThird, a broader range of participants: the payments market has expanded to include competition from big techs and major retailers, which are following a wide range of strategies in this respect. The flipside of this trend is that the increasingly global nature of the market is raising sovereignty issues, including those relating to the control of data when the providers are located outside the region or jurisdiction where they offer their services.\\nLast, the crave for blockchain technology: all around the world, market participants and big techs have launched or are preparing to launch new projects for tokens designed to serve as means of payment or settlement using the blockchain technology. We all have in mind first-generation crypto-assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, but there are now many others coming or foreseen, like the JP Morgan Coin, the UBS' Utility Settlement Coin or The Facebook' Libra.\\n2- The development of crypto-assets are part of the innovations fueled by these underlying trends affecting payment instruments and systems, combining the search for anonymity, management of non-intermediated peer-to-peer payments and the use of entirely web-based technologies. But they also have their specificities. Actually, they have unique financial, monetary and technical features which set them apart from the currencies and payment instruments issued by financial institutions and central banks. Regarding the first wave of crypto-assets which have been brought to the market, they are not a claim on any natural or legal entity, they do not have a guaranteed fixed exchange rate with the currency issued by the central bank and they rely extensively for their circulation on blockchain, a distributed ledger technology system using cryptographic techniques. A second wave might develop in the form of \\xab stablecoin \\xbb with a potentially global reach, some of which sponsored by large technology or financial firms, whose distinctive feature, beyond their potentially large size and reach, is that they seek to stabilize their value by linking it to an asset or a pool of assets.\\nWhat are the specific benefits of such blockchain-based initiatives?\\nFirst, the blockchain technology and more broadly the DLT could help answer market's needs and demands. There is in particular a strong demand for quick and safe cross-border payment solutions, available 24h/24, enabling smooth exchanges. There are a number of local instant payment solutions already in place in a number of countries in particular in Europe, available 24/7, settling retail payment orders up to 15 000 euros in less than 15 seconds. A certain number of initiatives follow the European Payment Council SCTinst scheme. The Eurosystem has even launched its own service, under the name of TIPS to help ensure a pan-European reach.\\nHowever, these solutions are costly for end users and, at the global level, we are far from having a network (or set of interconnected networks) that would support quick and cheap transfers of funds.\\nSecond, and in close relation to the previous point, the DLT could help remedy the current limits of the existing wholesale market infrastructures. Those wholesale infrastructures also have various shortcomings. Since RTGS are not interoperable, correspondent banking is often the only solution to transfer fiat money across borders. However, correspondent banking is costly, and the perimeter of the AML/CTF and KYC checks is in some cases uncertain for the counterparties of a payment order. Furthermore, for security reasons, the access to payment systems is limited to a certain type of entities (mainly credit institutions, investment firms, ancillary systems, etc.). Finally, cross-border payments lack traceability. The DLT could also help improve current aspects of wholesale clearing and settlement mechanisms and facilitate in particular gross and simultaneous Delivery-versus-Payment processes, cross currency settlements and resilience and recovery from operational incidents.\\nIf the issues at stake are not the same in developed as in developing countries, the objectives of crypto-assets, and in particular stablecoins, are the same everywhere. They seek to shortcut central authorities and more generally financial intermediaries. However, they bring their own problems.\\n3- Indeed, it is quite clear that crypto-assets undergoing technical and economic trials bring about not only opportunities to improve our payment systems but also material risks which on the contrary might weaken them if unaddressed, both from an efficiency perspective and a safety perspective through the introduction of new sources of fragmentation, instability and fraud.\\nAs many central bankers have pointed out, today's crypto-assets do not satisfactorily offer the qualities expected from a settlement asset to be used interchangeably with commercial bank money and central bank money, let alone to displace central bank money as the central reference of value, as the privileged settlement asset for wholesale transactions and as the last recourse settlement asset given its legal tender status. The reasons for this assessment are well known and documented and boil down to stressing that there are misnamed as \\xab currencies \\xbb for three reasons:\\nFirst, their value fluctuates enormously, preventing them from being used as units of account. For instance, the value of Bitcoin (not however representative of all crypto-assets) went up to more than 19 300 euros in December 2017 and has since fallen down to 7400 euros in September this year. And stablecoins represent an imperfect improvement in this field: their value aims to be relatively stable based on backed assets, but in fact fluctuates, in particular if they are not backed on safe assets. As a result, very few prices are denominated in crypto-assets and not many large brick-and-mortar or online retailers accept bitcoin for example, although there are some exceptions [i.e. showroomprive\\u0301.com, France's second largest flash sale web retailer, which has accepted bitcoins since 2014].\\nSecond, as intermediaries in exchanges, crypto-assets are far less effective than a settlement asset with legal tender status, insofar as (i) their price volatility makes it hard to use them as a means of payment, (ii) they generate transaction fees that are far too high for simple retail transactions (for instance, the redemption fee on Tether is 3%), and (iii) they offer no guarantee of a refund in the event of fraud.\\nThird, the fact that they have no intrinsic value and that they offer no guarantee that they can be converted at par upon demand with commercial bank money or central bank money means that they cannot be used to create trustworthy stores of value.\\nIn addition, crypto-assets \\xab front end \\xbb and \\xab back-end \\xbb payment arrangements are significantly exposed to risks of various nature, including legal, financial, operational and compliance risk with money laundering and terrorist financing, consumer and investor protection, which need to be seriously addressed if they are not to become the \\xab weak links \\xbb in our payment systems, with the risk that they undermine the safety of the whole payment chain. From that perspective, stablecoins of potential large size and reach may pose additional challenges of system-wide importance, to competition policy, financial and monetary stability.\\nII- Public policy challenges, in particular for central banks, and how to address them.  \\n1- In that context, various courses of action are available to the public authorities.\\nThe first would be to ignore crypto-assets. But even if the volumes in play remain small and do not represent a threat to financial stability, the risks that I mentioned earlier must be addressed. This is all the more true for stablecoins which raise the most serious issues and deserve attention and responses before they possibly meet a significant market demand. \\nThe second course of action would be to ban crypto-assets outright because of these same risks. Several countries have already gone down this route, including China in 2013 and Russia in 2017.\\nA third option, and the one that has so far been the preferred response in Europe and France to innovations with the potential to change the payment services market, is to establish appropriate regulations that make it possible to reconcile two key imperatives:\\n- First, address the risks that I mentioned\\n- Second, preserve the potential for technological innovation offered by crypto-assets\\nTo that end, should we reconsider or reaffirm the two current core features of our payment systems (see: the role of central bank money in payment systems-CPSS 2003)? Namely:\\n- the coexistence and competition of central bank money and private money (mainly so far commercial bank money) as settlement assets\\n- the anchor role of central bank money\\nMy answer to this question would be to reaffirm and therefore preserve those core features which have served well the public interest of financial and monetary stability. But this does not mean that we should aim for the status quo both in terms of regulatory and oversight frameworks and in terms of services that central banks should offer in providing central bank money as a settlement asset in payment systems.\\n2- A number of risks to which crypto-assets payment arrangements are exposed are familiar and in this respect, existing regulatory and oversight frameworks only require to be adapted to address them. To that end, three key issues to be considered are the legal qualification of crypto- assets, venues used to exchange them and the conditions under which a crypto-asset can be exchanged into another one, in commercial bank money or in central bank money. France has already moved into that direction with the adoption of a regulatory regime for blockchains, tokens and ICOs. After a Blockchain Ordinance authorizing some specific security tokens to be seen as securities when they are not registered in a central security depository, France adopted in May this year a legislation on crypto-assets, referred to as the PACTE bill. The bill includes henceforth provisions on blockchains, tokens, ICOs and providers of crypto-asset services.\\nHowever, adaptation of local national regimes should fit into a larger regulatory framework to be adopted at global level. There is indeed a need for overall consistency to prevent regulatory arbitrage under the \"same activities, same risks, same rules\" principle, and also to address risks that fall outside existing frameworks, including risks for fair competition and for transmission of monetary policy. Indeed, in July 2019, G7 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors agreed that possible stablecoins initiatives must meet the highest regulatory standards, be subject to prudent supervision and oversight and that possible regulatory gaps should, as a matter of priority, be assessed and addressed. Accordingly, at global level, several groups are working on a global regulatory and supervisory approach towards crypto-assets and a G7 working group is finalizing a report investigating specifically the impact of global stable coins, which should be published shortly.\\n3- But adapting the regulatory framework might not be enough. To preserve the advantages of multiple issuers of settlement assets in providing innovative, efficient and safe means of payment, central banks as issuers of the reference settlement asset may contribute further in revisiting and improving the conditions under which they make available that settlement asset.\\nIn that perspective, a possibility regularly mentioned is that central banks issue their money in digital form, the so-called concept of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). It is important here to draw a distinction between a retail CBDC, accessible to the general public, and a wholesale CBDC, accessible only to financial intermediaries.\\nAs regards retail CBDC, different motivations to introduce it can be considered.\\nOne motivation could be for instance the need to cope with a significant demand for digital payment solutions and avoid that the supply be ensured only by private payment structures (e.g. Libra) or a non-euro area CBDC, which may achieve significant market power, thus posing risks to security and financial stability. Another motivation could be the political will to ensure the accessibility of central bank money for the general public, in particular in countries where the use of cash in payments is declining. There may be other reasons.\\nBut my feeling is that, at this stage, the \"business case\" for pushing a retail CBDC at the scale of the Euro area is somehow weak. I don't believe anyhow that such an initiative should be conceived as a mean to counterbalance private initiatives such as Libra, keeping also in mind that the weaknesses the latter intends to address in cross-border payments may not be more easily handled by such CBDC. Furthermore, the macroeconomic implications of the issuance of a CBDC must be sufficiently well understood and anticipated before the introduction of CBDC for retail purposes can be considered.\\nMotivations for a wholesale CBDC are of a different nature. We already begin to observe a tokenization of financial assets (securities or means of settlement) exchanged between financial actors. The risk there is that such a trend leads to disorderly approaches and heterogeneous adaptations of market infrastructures, in particular when it comes to the modalities of settlement. Several initiatives or projects are in effect considered by the industry in the post-trade area, pointing to the role central banks could play in this regard, as they have done in the past.  Against this background, the potential role of a wholesale CBDC is in my view worth considering if not desirable.\\nBut all in all, I would say that, whatever the final orientations taken, we shouldn't refrain from experimenting the different forms of CBDC.\\nAnother contribution for central banks could be to help address one the major failings of the current payment systems which is cross-border retail payments, which is one of the drivers of the development of crypto-assets.\\nOne solution to the weaknesses of private initiatives in the field of cross-border payments could be to interconnect these systems. It is technically and legally feasible for a given area, for example, in the euro zone. However, at the global scale, between systems of different areas, it is more complex, in particular when several currencies are involved.\\nAnother domain where progress can be made is promoting the adoption of common international industry standards facilitating the interoperability of payment systems at global scale. In particular, it would be necessary to foster the harmonization of domestic and international regulations with respect to AML/CTF, KYC. Developing support programs for countries with underdeveloped payment infrastructures could also enhance financial inclusion by strengthening the development of local domestic and cross-border payment systems.\\nWe need to work further on these important issues - and will do so.\\nIn conclusion, it is hard to anticipate the role that crypto-assets might play in the payment system of the future, especially since the characteristics and features of these assets look set to change considerably. While it is clear that crypto-assets undergoing technical and economic trials bring about opportunities to improve our payment systems, they can also bring material risks to our payment systems which, if unaddressed, might introduce new sources of fragmentation, instability and fraud. In that context, beyond contributing to the adaptation of the regulatory framework to address those risks, central banks may contribute further in revisiting and possibly improving the conditions under which they make available central bank money for settlement purposes. The intrinsically digital and global nature of crypto-assets means however that a coordinated international approach is necessary to be effective in addressing the issues raised by crypto-assets. The work currently underway by the G7 and also the FSB, under this aegis of the G20, should therefore be seen as important and promising.\\nThank you for your attention."

DNB's resolution director Nicole Stolk opened the seminar with a speech in which she summarized the Dutch experience with bank resolution within the European context. She concluded by pointing out the two challenges for resolution in the near future: engaging with the banks and close cooperation between all parties involved.\\n***\\nGood morning and welcome to Amsterdam. We are here today in the Presidents' Room. If you look over to the far wall you can see that all the former presidents of De Nederlandsche Bank are watching us. At the top left is our very first President, Paul Iwan Hogguer. In 1814 he was appointed by King Willem the First of the Netherlands to oversee the creation of DNB. He was also mayor of Amsterdam at the same time! As the son of a Swiss banker and a Prussian mother, and with a brother who served as a diplomat at the Portuguese and the Russian courts, he would have appreciated such esteemed international company. As I am sure you do.\\nOne of the main goals of this seminar is to meet each other and to share our experiences. It's good to see such a diverse range of nationalities. Most of you are from countries of the Dutch-Belgium IMF constituency. But we also have with us representatives from other jurisdictions, such as Indonesia, Egypt and Albania. There is also diversity in how you approach resolution. The different resolution regimes may of course reflect specific aspects of a jurisdiction, such as the structure of its banking sector. But each country's approach is also shaped by its history in dealing with a banking crisis. Some jurisdictions are already at an advanced stage in developing a designated resolution function. Others are just getting started. Some, like the Ukraine, have already dealt with resolution cases in the past, while others may have little hands on experience. This seminar is aimed at high-level management, to discuss the more strategic issues. The focus is on how resolution regimes are set up, as well as the guiding principles for resolution. The banking industry operates increasingly on a cross-border basis. This means effective cooperation between regulators is vital."

        "title": "Vitas Vasiliauskas: Labour market in the 21st century - the way forward",
        "content": "Dear guests and distinguished speakers: A sincere 'thank you' for joining us at the yearly Lithuanian economics conference organised by the Bank of Lithuania.\\nThis marks our third annual economics conference. The first one tackled income inequality. Last year, we brainstormed on how to create a sustainable pension system that would seem trustworthy not only to its creators, but also to the people of Lithuania.\\nIt is obvious that we do not steer clear of difficult topics. Quite the opposite - we are creating a meaningful tradition of gathering every year to deliberate on the fundamentals: urgent issues that pose high risks. In other words, we are taking the initiative to seek measures that could solve - or at least facilitate solving - key problems. Especially those that demand a systematic approach.\\nThis is precisely why we have invited you to discuss the labour market this year. We consider labour market dynamics an alarming issue. Labour market developments are among the strongest factors - and possibly the strongest one - contributing to where we will find ourselves in 50, 20 or even 10 years. What do I mean exactly?\\nAccording to Eurostat data and taking into account differences in prices, before the crisis Lithuania's GDP per capita amounted to a meagre 60% of the EU average. Today, we have reached more than 80% of the Community's average. Of course, GDP per capita is not a perfect indicator of well-being. Nonetheless, we cannot deny it - convergence is progressing. With household income growing at a faster rate than the overall price level, this process is felt by an increasingly larger fraction of society. And this is the good news.\\nHowever, there is also bad news. This is how I would describe it: convergence will not be sustainable nor long-lasting if we do not overcome the growing challenges of the labour market. We have seen instances in the EU when convergence among countries stalls. Or, even worse, when countries start moving backwards instead of forwards. The main hindrences in such economies are often found in their labour markets.\\nColleagues,\\nI do not wish to sound overly pessimistic. If we did not believe that we still have the time and the skills to identify the correct solutions, we would not have invited you to this discussion. Therefore, I am going to name three issues that I deem of utmost importance when considering economic policy proposals today. These are: demographics, technological progress and regional disparities.\\nLet us take the first item, demographics. In the past 20 years, the working-age population in Lithuania has shrunk by almost a quarter. Today, there are around 1.8 million working-age individuals. If no significant changes occur, there will be fewer than 1.5 million working-age people in 2030, and just over a million in 20601.\\nIt is important to note here that this year we will be able to mark the net migration rate in green rather than red, meaning that more people are coming to Lithuania than leaving it. Therefore, the total population should increase - for the first time since 1992.\\nLet's not deceive ourselves, though. One year is not enough to claim a sustainable trend.\\nAdditionally, immigration (at least at the current pace) is not going to be a demographic magic bullet. The decrease of working-age population is going to continue in Lithuania as the ageing of the population will outweigh the positive impact of immigration.\\nUnder these circumstances, some employers, especially in certain sectors, are already forced to compete for every single employee by increasing wages. This is good news for workers. However, with wages growing faster than efficiency, in the long term we are risking a loss of competitiveness and the positions that we have fought for in foreign markets.\\nAnd that would be terrible news for everybody. Hence, it is likely that our country's employers, seeking to avoid that turn of events, will pursue ways to adapt to the decreasing number of employees other than offering larger wages.\\nResearch shows that human-performed task automation is likely to happen more swiftly in countries faced with demographic challenges2. As such, there is an imperative to discuss the challenges and possibilities of technological progress.\\nAccording to the OECD calculations3, medium risk of job automation in Lithuania amounts to more than 50%. This means that a person could be replaced by a robot in every second current workplace.\\nThere would certainly be losers in this situation: those who are swept away by the wave of progress and find themselves in a worse position than the one they began in. This would place an additional burden on the social security system.\\nBut how many winners would this bring? Those who have new jobs created by the technological progress? Are we ready to reap the rewards of the fourth industrial revolution - to successfully apply big data, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology?\\nTo prepare ourselves for that, we are going to need highly qualified workers. Yet, there is already a shortage of them even today. In Lithuania, around a third of the population falls into a qualification mismatch category, meaning that their skills do not match labour market demands.\\nLet us not forget that the negative effects of technological development are geographically imbalanced. Less urbanised locations will probably face faster development of automation due to the prevailing type of work there. These ongoing processes may further increase labour market inequality between Lithuania's regions.\\nThis leads us to the third challenge we are going to delve into today: regional disparity.\\nIt is already evident that more and more jobs are being created in large cities rather than in peripheral areas. Up until the crisis of 2008, the unemployment rate in big cities matched the rate in the more remote regions. After the crisis, profound differences came to the fore: the average unemployment rate in such regions is double the size of that in cities.\\nChanges in Lithuania's economic structure shrunk the importance of the agricultural sector and amplified that of the service sector. Clearly, regions find it difficult to adapt to these structural changes. What we have there now is structural unemployment - something that cannot be reduced even by the fast overall expansion of the country's economy.\\nWe are also witnessing the consequences of persistent unemployment. People are leaving smaller cities. Birth and mortality rates are quite similar throughout the counties in Lithuania, but migration rates differ significantly. Over the last 20 years, the number of young age workers in our country's regions has shrunk by a half, except for the three biggest cities.\\nColleagues,\\nI have just set forth three problems that we consider paramount. How are we to solve them? We have no crystal ball to turn to for answers. We can turn to each other, though. We have gathered here to try to arrive at possible ways of overcoming these challenges by means of discussion and search for best international practises.\\nEach of the challenges I have identified is quite distinct from the others. Together, however, they are so closely connected that at first sight it is hard to tell cause and consequence apart. It is like the proverbial chicken-and-egg. Clearly, then, in order to achieve real results, we must act on several fronts at once while bearing in mind the big picture.\\nFirstly, we have to create regulatory labour market instruments that combine employer flexibility and safety of the employee. Moreover, such instruments should stimulate more active participation of different population groups in the labour market. I am thus thrilled that the keynote speech will shortly be delivered by Professor Werner Eichhorst, one of the most prominent experts of labour market regulation policy in Europe.\\nIt is also obvious that Lithuania is in desperate need of long-term and far-sighted migration policy to both entice emigrants to return home and attract foreign workers.\\nWhat is more, when discussing quantity, we should not forget quality, especially if we seek to prepare ourselves for technological changes and the impending fourth industrial revolution.\\nWhat skills will be most in demand? No one knows. And anyone who thinks they do are probably mistaken. As the astronaut Buzz Aldrin once said, 'You promised me colonies on Mars. And instead, I got... Facebook'. I take this to mean that we can only guess what the future has in store for us. Which is why we have to move towards an educational system that is flexible and oriented towards lifelong learning, both formal and informal, including adult education and effective retraining. Such a system is the only way to prepare our people for rapid structural change.\\nLastly, we need a real regional policy - one that is effective and adequate for the current situation. One that would not only help maintain economic life throughout Lithuania, but would also prompt a shift towards higher value-added economic activities.\\nUndoubtedly, education should have an especially important place in this policy in order to ensure equally good quality of education to all children in all parts of the country. In Lithuania, schoolchildren in cities are ahead of their peers in rural areas by one year in assessment of their mathematics skills. This difference is two times larger than the average for the developed countries4.\\nHence, we are not providing equal opportunities for young people to graduate from school, obtain high-level qualifications and find a well-paid job. And this is an especially unfair form of inequality of opportunities. It creates a vicious cycle: the number of jobs that ensure dignified income in rural regions is not increasing, at least not at a rate that we would like. Yet, with the lack of a qualified labour force, investors who create high added-value are not coming to these regions - so they are not creating such work places.\\nDear Colleagues,\\nAs I have mentioned, we have chosen the topic of the labour market for this conference because we consider it one of today's most burning issues. Additionally, we chose it because economists' projections, unfortunately, show the worst-case scenarios as the more likely ones. But the main reason is that we can still adjust those scenarios so that the curves go upwards rather than downwards.\\nI am aware that we will neither make nor implement decisions today. Yet, seeing such a professional, engaged and competent group of participants, I am confident that we can stimulate a positive turn.\\nThat is my hope for all of us here.\\nI thank you for your time, and wish you fruitful discussions.\\n1 Eurostat projections.\\n2 E.g.

        "title": "Joachim Wuermeling: Introduction to the book \"Banking Business in Germany\"",
        "content": "Introduction\\nLadies and gentlemen,\\nThank you very much for the invitation. It is my pleasure to introduce the 6th edition of \"Banking Business in Germany\".\\nPrevious editions have been a valuable guide, with clear and insightful descriptions of\\nThe structure of the German banking sector,\\nthe structure of banking supervision in Germany and the EU, and\\nthe relevant legislation for banks and investment firms active in Germany.\\nThese information are very helpful for foreign banks entering the German market, which is why it has become something of a go-to guide.\\nAs this book is about German Banking I would like to take this opportunity to make three remarks on the sector.\\nFirst, I would like to make a brief assessment of the Brexit preparations.\\nSecond, I would stake stock of the incoming financial institutions due to Brexit\\nThird, I will then talk about the strategic options post Brexit.\\nState of Brexit preparations\\nThe book as well as the Association of Foreign Banks in Germany are as important as ever given the developments we are seeing due to Brexit. This event has a major impact on the German banking sector not only in the short, but also in the long term.\\nFor the short term, I may say that banks and supervisors have more or less completed preparations for a hard Brexit. This is due to the hard word of the banks but also to the clear stance of supervisors and - last but not least- the delay from March to October. We as supervisors have been very strict; we saw no alternative than to prepare for the worst-case scenario, which is a hard Brexit. That proved to be the right stance, despite of the promising rumours ahead of this week's European Council meeting and glowing hopes that there finally may be a withdrawal agreement between the EU and the UK.\\nA hard Brexit is exactly what institutions have been preparing for in recent months. I am well aware that this was a very challenging process for all firms, but I am convinced that these strict measures are a valuable advantage in light of the current, difficult circumstances.\\nMoreover, in areas where banks were not able to do this alone, like in clearing, contingency measures are in place to contain key risks.\\nOne thing needs to be very clear, however. Contingency measures are - quite rightly - temporary; they do not relieve institutions for aligning with the new legal environment.\\nYet, the uncertainty of how Brexit will take place and what future partnership will follow, has weighed on the banks' preparations. It has also led to a withholding of the transfer of portfolios until the last moment, until the final decision concerning Brexit is taken. This creates an additional operational risk of course, when enormous sums (trillions) are to be shifted overnight.\\nThe risk of the uncertainty remains though. There is no playbook and no experience for a thing like Brexit. But as of today I do not expect a risk for financial stability even in the case of a hard Brexit.\\nThankfully, I can provide another reassurance here. We are unlikely to see a bottleneck in the supply of financial services or even a credit crunch. The vast majority of financial services and products should still be available on the continent even after Brexit.\\nIncoming financial institutions\\nLadies and gentlemen,\\nSome simple numbers on business coming into the German financial market reveal the extraordinary impact.\\nIn a first wave, we expect roughly 2,000 employees to be transferred from Britain to or newly recruited in Germany in the wake of Brexit.\\nThere have been 22 Brexit-related licensing procedures for credit institutions in the SSM as a whole, of which eight were for Germany. Of these, seven have since been finalised, and the remaining licence probably won't be pursued.\\nA further ten credit institution procedures concerned an expansion of business activities in the SSM under existing licences; three of these were in Germany.\\n41 licencing procedures concerned investment firms. Germany accounted for nine of them, all of which have been finalised.\\nIn addition, we have seen the Brexit-related establishment or expansion of seven branches of third country firms, five branches of banks domiciled in the European Economic Area and two financial holding companies in Germany.\\nAt present, the target operating models (TOMs) available to us envisage an increase in asset positions in the total amount (i.e. across credit institutions and investment firms) of around \\u20ac637 billion, or about 300%. In the SSM, the 11 largest banks are set to transfer \\u20ac 1.1 trillion of assets.\\nIn my view, it is especially striking that the aggregate total assets of the securities trading banks operating in Germany up to now (as a peer of investment firms) came to around \\u20ac350 million; now there will be individual institutions in this segment with total assets ranging from \\u20ac100 billion to over \\u20ac400 billion. Individual investment firms therefore account for many times the existing overall market in Germany.\\nLet me conclude here with a caveat: This is only a snapshot for day one and certainly not the end of the story. The figures may further develop depending if a hard Brexit will happen or not and how the future relationship between the UK und EU will be shaped. Much more business may be transferred along the road - depending on individual decisions of the banks and their clients.\\nStrategic options post Brexit\\nThat leads me to strategic options post Brexit.\\nAfter all, the outcome of the Brexit negotiations and the future relationship between the UK and the EU27 will obviously influence the structures in which institutions are able to operate after Brexit.\\nBut whatever form Brexit takes, the consequences will shape financial markets for years, and probably decades, to come.\\nWhat will Brexit - and the resultant changes in capital flows - mean for the future of the EU27 financial market?\\nHaving said that, we have to assume that Brexit will transform financial markets. So the question is what shape the EU27's financial market will take in future - and which strategy the EU should pursue for the future of its financial markets. Essentially, there are two options.\\nOption A: We aim to maintain close links - despite the UK losing its passporting rights, we attempt to preserve a special relationship and thus continue to rely heavily on London's financial hub.\\nOption B: We rely more on building capacity within the EU - whether it's by expanding EU capacity or increasing the number of independent subsidiaries of foreign institutions.\\nIn my evaluation, option B might be the better strategy for the EU and for Germany. The reason for this is that cross-border risk couldn't be adequately controlled under option A; dependency on London would then be especially problematic.\\nBut what exactly does option B entail?\\nFirst off, it means rigorous implementation of the \"no empty shells\" policy, which is to say that the risk management and capital of institutions operating here have to be accessible to local supervisors.\\nSecond, it means no preferential treatment for London beyond existing equivalency arrangements; this could possibly be improved slightly, as currently planned by the Commission.\\nThis brings us to my third point: some new capacity will have to be created in the EU, and at the same time the internal market has to be deepened in terms of financial integration.\\nWhat should happen is that national and regional efforts should be consolidated under the umbrella of a common European strategy to deepen and modernise the internal market for financial services.\\nI firmly believe that digitalisation holds the key to our success. We are all familiar with examples of how smart digital applications have helped to make buying and selling more transparent (e.g. comparison websites), to break down language barriers (e.g. translation services), to overcome information problems and to build trust (blockchain applications).\\nUltimately, the continental financial centres need a strong digital market infrastructure that makes full use of all new digital possibilities. Only then they can effectively overcome fragmentation.\\nTo sum up, it is my firm view that deepening and modernising the European internal market is the best economic strategy to counter the geopolitical challenges posed by Brexit.\\nWhich brings us to the new European Commission. The team of Ursula von der Leyen will officially go to work in Brussels on 1 November 2019. They will shape how the EU approaches our economy's biggest challenges, and they can decisively shape the financial market strategy.\\nVon der Leyen has nominated Valdis Dombrovskis for the important role of Executive Vice-President for an 'Economy that Works for People'. As such, he will lead the work on deepening Economic and Monetary Union.\\nVon der Leyen has set the goal for Dombrovskis, namely that \"Europe's social market economy helps ensure that social fairness and prosperity go hand in hand\" (quote from Ursula von der Leyen's mission letter to Valdis Dombrovskis). It should also be climate-neutral and work within the ecological boundaries of the planet.\\nThe mission letter states the following goals: \"to preserve and improve financial stability, protect savers and investors and ensure the flow of capital to where it is needed.\"\\nTo achieve these goals she has identified eight crucial priorities. The new Commission aims:\\nTo complete the Banking Union,\\nTo speed up the work towards a Capital Markets Union to diversify sources of finance for companies and tackle the barriers to the flow of capital,\\nTo develop a new private-public fund specialising in initial public offerings for SMEs,\\nTo put forward a FinTech strategy to support new digital technologies in our financial system,\\nTo ensure a common approach with member states on cryptocurrencies, and\\nTo develop a green financing strategy to ensure that we can direct investment and financing to the transition to a climate-neutral economy.\\nI very much welcome this ambitious open and clear course.\\nThe financial market agenda in particular provides us with a suitable framework for thinking strategically about the most important developments over the coming five years and the long-term way ahead.\\nMoreover, I think we should be even bolder when it comes to the three principles of integrated markets, digitisation and sustainable finance as a basis for our success.\\nIn my view, we must come up not only with a FinTech strategy, but also with a bolder approach to digitisation in finance and how this will transform the economy and international trade. Libra or stable coins more generally, cyber-security in algorithmic trading and elsewhere, artificial intelligence and its ethical as well as labour and financing implications, open banking and its implications, BigTechs and how they will affect competition policies and financial stability - these are only the tip of this strategic iceberg.\\nThe ideas behind green finance are still relatively new, and most banks don't have them on their radar - neither the opportunities nor the risks that they entail.\\nBanks have to strengthen their management of climate-related risks substantially.\\nBut when it comes to regulation, I do not think that we should try to further sustainability through lowering risk weights - a green supporting factor would be the wrong instrument.\\nIntegrated, digital, green finance can be a huge lever for achieving the goal of a sustainable economy that works for all.\\nTherefore, it is of vital importance that we, the EU27, pursue a resilient financial market strategy that rests on three principles: integration, digitalisation, and sustainability.\\nConclusion\\nLadies and gentlemen,\\nlet me conclude my remarks leaving Brexit and commenting a statement of the book. On page 97 it reads: \"Progress to achieve greater stability has been made.\"\\nI can confirm that suggestion. Looking back the last 12 month a lot has been done. Big banks are undergoing deep restructuring. Small and mediums sized banks are adapting to the low interest rate environment, as our LSI-stress test revealed. Public-sector banks are heading for new horizons. That are good news for a German, even though vulnerabilities and big challenges remain.\\nThank you very much for your Attention."

Danes are heavy users of digital solutions and both the public sector and the private sector provide a vast amount of digital services such as online banking and e-commerce.

But at the same time, developments in the housing market, both the established market and housing construction, have a broader impact than the simple numbers would suggest.\\nThis has been known for a long time, but often housing cycles have occurred simultaneously with other events. For example, the housing downturn in the early 1990s occurred at the same time as the 90s recession. As a result, it can be difficult to fully isolate the direct effect of the housing market itself from the other forces at work. We have models which go some way towards doing this, but they also tend to suffer from the problem of disentangling the various factors.\\nOver the past few years, the housing cycles have moved in different directions, and varied quite considerably around the country."

        "content": "Mr C\\u0153ur\\xe9, the working group on stablecoins you've been chairing is expected to provide policy recommendations to G7 ministers on 17 October. What will be the gist of what you're going to tell them?\\nIt's important to expand the discussion on global stablecoins to embrace the broader context of technological changes in payments so that we may have a wider discussion on the mix of solutions - both public and private - that can bring the benefits of technological improvements to the end users. Stablecoins are only one component of this discussion. They raise a multifaceted technological and regulatory debate, covering financial regulation and anti-money laundering, as well as non-financial issues such as privacy, data and taxes. Stablecoins also raise deeper public-policy issues, particularly regarding the definition of money and monetary sovereignty.\\nThe report offers a framework for exploring these and related topics. It helps to structure the discussion, starting with how global payments work, what the shortcomings are and how stablecoins fit into this discussion, before addressing a number of issues specifically related to global stablecoins.\\nHow important is it to tackle the issue jointly at the global level?\\nIt's essential that the discussion of global stablecoins is inclusive. If and when stablecoins become live and reach global scale, they will have a different impact in different jurisdictions. Scale is important here.\\nWhat we want to see is international cooperation and coordination on regulatory approaches, potentially leading, as needed, to international standards - which we already have in some fields such as payments. All jurisdictions are now reviewing existing regulation to see how it applies to stablecoins. In Europe, the European Commission is carrying out this review. We will have to consider whether the existing regulations suffice or whether they will have to be adapted to address stablecoins.\\nThat's why this discussion is also taking place at the G20 level, and I would argue it should go beyond the G20 perimeter so we can reach out to developing countries too. We very much count on the IMF and the World Bank to help us on that.\\nAre any jurisdictions more vulnerable than others?\\nThe stakes are probably higher in small, open, developing economies. On the one hand, they may enjoy more potential benefits in the form of cheaper and faster payments, in particular for cross-border payments and remittances, and more financial inclusion. On the other, they may incur higher costs owing to the possible risks relating to monetary policy transmission and monetary sovereignty, in particular in economies which are partly dollarised. \"Dollarisation\" can easily morph into \"stablecoinisation\" (with apologies for the neologism!). We're flagging this in the report and it deserves closer consideration, which in my view the IMF should lead.\\nThis is just the start of what looks like a long process of tackling the challenges of stablecoins. What would be the next immediate steps?\\nThe plan is to pass the baton to the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The FSB has launched a new working group on the regulatory implications of stablecoins, which I co-chair with Chia Der Jiun from the Monetary Authority of Singapore. This group will focus on regulatory frameworks and approaches, starting with a stocktake of how different jurisdictions intend to deal with stablecoins. This will feed into a report that will be submitted for public consultation in April 2020.\\nCan you give us a flavour of the scope of the challenges stablecoin projects involve?\\nThe list of issues raised by all stablecoin projects is already quite long, as you know from our July report. They relate to legal certainty - to put it simply, on what or whom is the stablecoin a claim - and also to the governance and the architecture of each project. Other aspects have to do with compliance with money laundering and anti-terrorism financing rules and the question of whether a stablecoin payment system is safe and efficient enough. We can use existing international standards as a reference in this regard.\\nThen there are issues related to operational resilience and cybersecurity, market integrity and investor protection, and data protection, particularly segregation between payment data and data being produced in a social network. And you have issues with tax compliance.\\nWhenever these projects are based on existing global networks, there's a chance that they may reach a critical size very quickly, which raises additional potential issues relating to financial stability, monetary policy and the functioning of the international monetary system.\\nAccording to Kenneth Rogoff, some prominent central banker told him the goal is to regulate Libra into oblivion. Is that a sentiment you share?\\nThe G7 report is not technology-specific and it is not company-specific. There are different stablecoin projects and there will be new ones. We want to set principles that are applicable to all. It's too early in the process to say whether individual projects will meet these principles.\\nThere is certainly no judgement that stablecoins shouldn't exist. In the case of Europe, neither the Commission nor the ECB intend to make Europe a no-fly zone for stablecoins. But stablecoins will have to meet the highest regulatory standards and adhere to broader public policy goals. When we talk about people's money, there is no trade-off between innovation and safety. We want to see both, as we do for any payment instrument.\\nDepending on the design and the details of each stablecoin initiative, the approval would be contingent on meeting the highest existing standards. It might also require new regulations and be contingent on adherence to broader public-policy goals. The bottom line is that the bar will be very high and it's too early to tell whether it will be reached.\\nAre there any projects that might be easier to handle than others?\\nI see substantial differences between projects aimed at retail participants and those confined to the wholesale world. It's more likely in my view that existing regulations would broadly apply to wholesale projects rather than to retail projects. But it's all very tentative and there's no conclusion yet.\\nWith Libra, we're looking at a player that'll dominate the market. Is that a concern you have?\\nIn the discussion on fintech regulation we've been accustomed to discussing small-scale projects. By and large, until recently, we've taken a sandbox approach to fintech regulation under which we could afford to give projects a chance and see how risks materialise. That's possible when the project is small enough. But now we have an elephant in the sandbox. So that approach doesn't work anymore.\\nWhat happens if the coin reaches a global scale? You have questions relating to the fair use of client data and to possible services that may not be planned initially, but could develop in the ecosystem, like what happens if a deposit-taking or lending activity emerges around the stablecoin, in which case it should be regulated as banking activity.\\nAre we then at the beginning of an historic shift in our approach toward money and payments?\\nThe payment universe, both locally and globally, has evolved very rapidly over the past five years. The last wave of technological change in payments was 20 years ago when central banks introduced real-time gross settlement systems (in our case, TARGET followed by TARGET2). The new wave is more focused on retail payments and driven by technology.\\nBefore passing any judgement, we have to start from the principle that innovation is good because it makes payments cheaper and faster. That's an area where we're learning a great deal from our African and Latin American colleagues. There's a lot of leapfrogging toward innovative solutions. In the end, the new landscape will be a mix of public and private solutions.\\nSo the key question for the years to come is how to combine core public infrastructures like the ECB's fast payment platform, TIPS, with private systems, and what impulse central banks can give to make this happen in an integrated way. This is a particular challenge in Europe where the retail payment world remains fragmented along national lines. The Eurosystem is working on it. We'd better act fast here, because we don't want this new world of payments to be dominated solely by US and Chinese actors. Europe has a particular interest in developing its own approach and standards so it can be safe and efficient at home and attractive as an international reference.\\nHow do stablecoins, private and public, fit into this discussion?\\nStablecoins have the potential to leverage technological change to bring new and cheaper services to customers - provided that the long list of risks I highlighted is addressed properly. You're asking me whether a public stablecoin will also fit into this landscape. That's an area where we're treading very carefully because the prospects differ across jurisdictions. Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) raise a number of serious questions to which we don't yet have answers. Although they might look like an attractive proposition for individuals wishing to reap the benefits of technology while holding a safe store of value, they may have shortcomings of their own: there are many ways to implement CBDCs, which we need to study carefully. If they make bank funding more fragile and more vulnerable to liquidity shocks and bank runs, then they might be bad for financial stability and financial intermediation. Central banks shouldn't have their heads in the sand and avoid that discussion. At the same time, we have to think through the consequences.\\nIf people have access to digital central bank money, isn't the central bank entering an unfair competition with the private sector?\\nIf the demand for cash in a country collapses, citizens would be left with no option but to use commercial money, even for small payments. There's a good case to be made that citizens should be offered the option of using central bank money for small payments, even in a digital world. You have an overarching public-policy goal, which is trust in the currency. But again, we have to think through the consequences. As long as CBDCs are using new technologies to do what we already do - issuing money - in a more cost-effective way, I'm all for it. But if that implies a world where the central bank is crowding out private banks and attracting all deposits; a world where the central bank is disintermediating private financial intermediation, then that would not be a place where we want to be, because we're a market economy and we need competition to generate innovation in the first place.\\nAll those arguments taken into account, are CBDCs part of our financial future?\\nI'm personally pretty sure CBDCs will come. I don't know how and in which form. It may come in different ways in different jurisdictions. The nature of money will change. It's not the first time this is happening - the nature of money has kept changing over the centuries. We've got to adapt so we can reap the benefits of technology. But the principles won't change. I'm convinced that one key evolution that dates back to the 17th century will remain: you need a public institution to anchor trust in the currency. I don't see any chance that we will move back to a system where money will only be issued by commercial entities and regulated by competition between these entities. Our economies are so complex that you need trust in the currency to be anchored in the rule of law. A social convention isn't enough. It's too fragile. That doesn't mean everything needs to be public. To echo Ludwig Erhard, you need as much commercial money as possible to reap the benefits of innovation and competition, and you need as much public money as needed to anchor the trust in the currency."

        "title": "Joachim Wuermeling: A new world ahead. What do sustainable finance and digitalisation mean for supervision?",
        "content": "1 Introduction\\nLadies and gentlemen,\\nSustainability and digitalisation are two megatrends of our time, and they are both highly relevant for the financial sector. They have been the showcase topics of many financial sector conferences already. But this here is a very specific conference - one by and for supervisors, designed to advance their knowledge.\\n2 Why to combine sustainable finance and digitalisation in one conference\\nLet us look at a major challenge for supervisors in the realm of sustainable finance: The analysis of climate-related risks and the quest for appropriate analytical methods. We know by now that our traditional and tested backward-looking approach is not up to the task; we need a forward-looking perspective. The task is complicated by the fact that climate-related risks tend to be long-term risks by nature. How can we tackle them? Can we make banks undergo a climate-related stress test? Is it even possible to go beyond our traditional horizon of three to five years without sacrificing too much accuracy?\\nI am not aiming for an answer here. My point is that when faced with these challenges, we struggle to tackle them using only our traditional methods.\\nRegarding the digitalisation of banks and the entire financial sector, we are making similar observations. You see, digitalisation extends far beyond digitising traditional businesses and processes - it has led to transformation of finance, and in some cases even disruption. It comes as no surprise that supervisors might feel insecure when applying the supervisory toolkit to innovative businesses.\\nJust as a random example, supervisors might be confronted with a financial institution whose mid-term goal is not to earn profits, but to grow as quickly as possible. This kind of strategy might be sensible in the age of platform-based companies fighting for market supremacy, take e.g. Libra. If business is all about \"the winner takes it all\", this alters not only economics, but also raises the question about the focus of supervision.\\nOf course, solvency and liquidity ratios remain at the core of our interest. But the next question is, how do we deal with all the new issues of a company growing at high speed - e.g. its long-term profitability or also its risk management keeping pace with expanding business? Does it suffice to confront bank managers with those issues at the annual regulatory meeting? Are targeted on-site inspections the best way forward? Existing supervisory standards do set the right framework, but supervisors might need clearer guidance in order to exert the necessary amount of pressure on the supervised entity.\\n3 Where do we stand?\\nSo where do we stand today?\\nAlthough sustainable finance is no longer an entirely new topic, it is still difficult to grasp. At the same time, we are clearly moving beyond great political speeches.\\nTo supervisors, tackling sustainable finance means tackling environmental, social and governance (\"ESG\") risks; here, we have so far mostly but not exclusively focused on climate-related risks. \\nMuch of the pioneering work at the international level is being done by the members of the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS). Compared to about one and a half years ago, when the newly founded NGFS entered into its productive phase, we have certainly made good progress.\\nWe have built a broad consensus that ESG risks, in particular climate-related risks, are financial risks.\\nAnd we have started analysing regulatory implications and setting supervisory expectations.\\nBut we are still in the process of developing an understanding of the channels through which these risks could materialise, from both the micro- and macroprudential perspectives. Unlike other risk factors, the way climate change-related developments including policy measures will impact the macro economy is not well understood. Our current activities could be considered as \"sensitivity analyses\" exploring potential vulnerabilities of the financial system under different assumptions. Of course, the objective of the global efforts on the part of central banks and supervisors is to add stress tests or scenario analyses to our toolbox.\\nTherefore, the CRR II and CRD V contain not only new disclosure provisions but also mandates for the European Banking Authority (EBA) to examine the integration of ESG risks into pillar 1 and pillar 2. Work on pillar 2 has already started and is being conducted jointly by the EBA and National Competent Authorities (NCAs) in the EBA Sustainable Finance Network. Here in Germany, a guidance note on the treatment of sustainability risks by financial institutions drafted by BaFin is currently up for public consultation. Other countries have already published supervisory statements.\\nBut: If you were to randomly pick a local supervisor and ask them about the role of ESG risks in day to day supervision, you would find climate-related risk relatively absent thus far. Overall, we are currently only beginning to move from theory to practice. And this is where the real challenge lies.\\nThere are several areas where progress is needed, the most pressing of which is risk management. We have recently surveyed all German LSIs and asked them to what extent they are taking into account climate-related risks in their risk management and what they are planning for the near future.\\nThe good news is: Around one-third have integrated climate-related risks into their risk assessment, at least in part. The not so good news: Around two-thirds have not integrated climate-related risks at all. Of these, only a third are planning to do so in the future.\\nOur findings are consistent with surveys among SIs conducted by the SSM, EBA, and the NGFS.\\nClearly, the integration of ESG or even only climate-related risks into banks' risk management is still in its early stages. This will have to change soon if we bear in mind the work on regulatory standards in the EU and BaFin's guidance note on ESG risks that is expected to be finalised before the end of the year, but more importantly because climate-related risks are relevant.\\nThis has been a short fly-over over the progress made so far regarding sustainable finance. How about digitalisation of the financial sector and supervisory challenges?\\nDigitalisation is not that new anymore; it has now diffused into various niche topics and existing supervisory compartments - e.g. cyber and IT security; third parties and open banking; business model analysis; regulatory perimeter (esp. regarding FinTechs and BigTechs). Also, the prudential and supervisory treatment of crypto tokens has become a separate realm - with many connections to traditional segments such as operational risk or prudential requirements.\\nWe have achieved significant progress in updating and concretising our standards, e.g. regarding IT-related expectations or also regarding outsourcing activities.\\nHowever, within most of those topics, fundamental questions remain. For example, should we directly supervise third parties such as cloud service providers? And how do we deal with IT becoming more and more crucial to the functioning of the financial sector? We do exert pressure on banks to remedy their gaps in IT risk management - but when it comes to regulatory action, the \"traditional\" focus of banking supervision, namely solvency and liquidity, is what counts. Is this logic still valid in the digital age?\\nSumming up, we are witnessing significant advances in both topics, but their practical design is not yet decided.\\n4 What are common strategic challenges?\\nNow the question is: What are underlying structural causes (if any) for that? And how should we best deal with these grounds in order to move forward quickly and successfully? I will confine myself to three aspects that I find particularly important.\\nFirst, both topics are per se very complex already, consuming time and energy in daily supervision and beyond.\\nThe NGFS nicely summed up the reasons for complexity: \"Assessing the impact of climate change can be challenging due to the uncertainties associated with the course of climate change itself, the breadth and complexity of transmission channels, first and second round effects as well as the need to consider, in aggregate, some combination of both physical and transition risks.\" Therefore, analysing how exactly they would influence a particular bank's balance sheet, let alone the entire financial system, is a very complex endeavour.\\nThe same holds for digital innovations. Have you had the chance to read through an outsourcing agreement? Today, banks tend to have multiple of such outsourcing relationships, and the share of processes outsourced to third party vendors is still increasing - especially due to digitalisation. For a supervisor, keeping up to date regarding outsourced processes may thus become a challenge in itself.\\nSecond and adding to the complexity, both topics require new expertise.\\nTo develop a climate stress test, we first need to understand the different scenarios of global warming and how weather and climate phenomena would develop under them. Assuming a given set of socioeconomic drivers, technologies and policies, we then need to translate climate-related risks and mitigation pathways for finance risk assessments, ideally at the asset level.\\nThe same holds for digital innovations. For example, there is no one-size-fits-all supervisory response for all types of crypto tokens; each individual case must be assessed on its own merits. This in turn requires going into the nitty-gritty of the business case and understanding its technological features along with its legal classification.\\nThird, they are horizontal topics that don't easily fit into the organisational structure of supervisory institutions. That makes grasping the topics in their entirety and treating them consistently difficult. The FinTech hubs and sustainable finance networks we are seeing emerge within supervisory institutions are an attempt to overcome this challenge.\\nIf our organisational structures do not fit and, more broadly, our supervisory structure doesn't fit, then we should not hesitate to adjust to the new realities. We must pinpoint where and how exactly we must adapt.\\nAnd that's the task I want to define for today and tomorrow.\\nHow do we deal with a lack of expertise in certain fields? Do we create it from within? Do we acquire it from without?\\nHow do we deal with the complexity and the horizontal nature of the topics?\\nHow can we improve cooperation between different departments internally, cooperation between each other and cooperation with other players like academia, NGOs, etc.?\\nThese are the questions I invite you to ponder over the coming two days.\\n5 Conclusion\\nLadies and gentlemen,\\nSustainable finance and digitalisation pose unprecedented challenges for supervisors. In some areas, they have exposed the limits of our current approach to supervision. And they are forcing us to adapt.\\nI have sketched some of the strategic challenges that follow, but I have not provided a solution. That is what I am inviting you to think about during the conference.\\nAnd in case you might get lost in details, remember that our anchor point is quite simple: to maintain our ability to perform solid supervision under new circumstances.\\nThank you for your attention."

        "content": "Introduction\\nRichard Haass,\\nSteven Sokol,\\nJohn Lipsky,\\nLadies and gentlemen,\\nIf our meeting had taken place 200 million years ago, my journey to New York would have been rather short. At that time, all of the land masses on Earth were joined together in the super-continent of Pangaea, including North America and Europe. And New York City, the spot where we are meeting today, would have been at the very heart of our common continent.\\nTectonic plate shifts caused Pangaea to break apart and created the world as we now know it. Since then, North America and Europe have been separated by the Atlantic Ocean. Indeed, our continents keep drifting apart by about one inch every year. Unfortunately, this may be true in the figurative sense as well: when it comes to the matter of mutual understanding on both sides of the Atlantic, the gap appears to be expanding rather than contracting.\\nBut there is a big difference between geology and geopolitics: while the continental drift between the United States and Europe cannot be slowed or halted, the political distance between them is neither inevitable nor irreversible. To bridge the divides, we have to talk to each other. That is why events like today's - and the activities by the Council on Foreign Relations and the American Council on Germany in general - are so important."

        "content": "Technology is driving rapid change in the way we make payments and in the concept of \"money.\" There is a long history of technological advances challenging the prevailing notions of money, from the trading of coins to the use of paper currency, to the electronic debiting and crediting of funds on the accounts of banks. Today, efforts by global stablecoin networks such as Facebook's Libra to establish the next chapter in the story of money are raising threshold questions about legal and regulatory safeguards, financial stability, and monetary policy. Because of its potential global reach, Facebook's Libra imparts urgency to the debate over what form money can take, who or what can issue it, and how payments can be recorded and settled.\\nReassessing Money\\nMoney has traditionally served three functions. Money facilitates payments as a medium of exchange, serves as a store of value that can be relied on for future use, and simplifies transactions by providing a common unit of account to compare the value of goods and services.\\nA decade ago, Bitcoin was heralded as a new kind of digital money that would address frictions in payments as well as serve as a unit of account and store of value without the need for centralized governance. Bitcoin's emergence created an entirely new payment instrument and asset class exchanged over a set of payment rails supported by distributed ledger technology. Distributed ledger technology may allow for a shared, tamper-resistant ledger that can be updated by anyone with sufficient computing power, in contrast to traditional recordkeeping systems built on a single ledger managed by a trusted central entity. But Bitcoin and some other early iterations of cryptocurrencies have exhibited extreme volatility, limited throughput capacity, unpredictable transaction costs, limited or no governance, and limited transparency, which have limited their utility as a means of payment and unit of account."

        "title": "Mario Draghi: IMFC Statement",
        "content": "Euro area developments and outlook\\nThe euro area economy has expanded at a slower pace since the beginning of last year, marking a sizeable moderation in the pace of economic expansion. According to the latest Eurostat release, quarterly GDP growth was 0.2% in the second quarter of 2019. This slowdown in growth mainly reflects the prevailing weakness of international trade in an environment of prolonged global uncertainties, which are particularly affecting the euro area manufacturing sector. These developments are also reflected in economic sentiment indicators that have continued to worsen over recent months. At the same time, the unemployment rate in the euro area has continued its downward trend, falling to its lowest level since May 2008. The number of people in employment has increased by more than 11 million since mid-2013. The services and construction sectors show ongoing resilience and the euro area expansion is also supported by favourable financing conditions, further employment gains and rising wages, the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance and the ongoing - albeit somewhat slower - growth in global activity.\\nSince the IMF Spring Meetings in April 2019, short-term economic projections have been revised downwards. The latest ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, published in September, put annual real GDP growth at 1.1% in 2019, 1.2% in 2020 and 1.4% in 2021. The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain tilted to the downside and mainly pertain to the prolonged presence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors, the rising threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets. We welcome a deal on an orderly exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union.\\nHeadline inflation in the euro area has lately been hovering around 1.0% and stood at 0.8% in September, lower than in the first months of this year, when it was around 1.5%. This largely reflects the decline in the annual rate of change in energy prices. Measures of underlying inflation remain generally muted. While labour cost pressures have strengthened and broadened amid tightening labour markets, their pass-through to inflation is taking longer than previously anticipated. Looking ahead, underlying inflation is expected to increase over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion and robust wage growth. The latest ECB staff projections foresee annual euro area headline inflation of 1.2% in 2019, 1.0% in 2020 and 1.5% in 2021.\\nLatest monetary policy decisions\\nConfronted with a more protracted weakness of the euro area economy, the persistence of prominent downside risks, and muted inflationary pressures, resulting in a continued shortfall of medium-term inflation with respect to its aim, the ECB's Governing Council decided in September on a package of monetary policy measures to support the convergence of inflation towards its medium-term inflation aim. This package includes the following elements:\\nThe interest rate on the deposit facility was reduced by 10 basis points, to -0.50%. The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it has seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within its projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics.\\nNet asset purchases will be restarted under the asset purchase programme (APP) at a monthly pace of \\u20ac20 billion as from 1 November. The Governing Council expects these purchases to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates, and to end shortly before it starts raising the key ECB interest rates.\\nReinvestment of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP will continue, in full, for an extended period of time past the date when the Governing Council starts raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.\\nThe modalities of the new series of quarterly targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) were changed to preserve favourable bank lending conditions, ensure the smooth transmission of monetary policy and further support the accommodative stance of monetary policy. The interest rate for TLTRO III can now be as low as the average interest rate on the deposit facility and the maturity of the operations was extended from two to three years.\\nFinally, the Governing Council decided to introduce a two-tier system for reserve remuneration in which part of banks' holdings of excess liquidity will be exempt from the negative deposit facility rate, so as to support the bank-based transmission of monetary policy.\\nThis comprehensive package of monetary policy decisions provides substantial monetary stimulus to ensure that financial conditions remain very favourable and support the euro area expansion, the ongoing build-up of domestic price pressures and, thus, the sustained convergence of inflation to the Governing Council's medium-term inflation aim. The Governing Council continues to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.\\nThe effectiveness of monetary policy can and should be enhanced by other policies. On the fiscal side, the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance is currently providing some support to economic activity. In view of the weakening economic outlook and the continued prominence of downside risks, governments with fiscal space that are facing a slowdown should act in an effective and timely manner. At the same time, governments in countries with high public debt should pursue prudent policies and deliver on their structural balance targets. This will create the conditions for automatic stabilisers to operate freely. All countries should reinforce their efforts to achieve a more growth-friendly composition of public finances. The implementation of structural policies in euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up. The transparent and consistent implementation of the EU's fiscal and economic governance framework, over time and across countries, also remains essential.\\nEuro area banking sector developments\\nThe resilience of the euro area banking sector remained solid and was supported by both microprudential and macroprudential actions, such as the increase of countercyclical capital buffers by national authorities in a number of countries. The aggregate Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of significant institutions at the end of the second quarter of 2019 stood at 14.3%, unchanged from the end of 2018. At the same time, vulnerabilities related to liquidity and funding risks, including those related to US dollar activities, have abated amid lower funding costs and broader access to bank bond markets. Non-performing loan ratios improved further to 3.6% over the first half of 2019, from 3.8% at the end of 2018. However, banks' profitability in the euro area remains low due to both structural and cyclical factors, with some weakening since the beginning of the year on account of slower economic growth.\\nThe financial stability environment remains challenging, as the global economic outlook has deteriorated. There are mild signs of overstretched valuations in the euro area in some riskier segments of the financial markets, as well as in real estate markets, with marked differences across regions. In addition, the non-bank financial sector has continued to take on risk.\\nIn this environment, it is particularly important to ensure that the financial sector maintains its resilience and has sufficient buffers in place that can be used in times of stress. These buffers would mitigate procyclicality and avoid excessive deleveraging if risks were to materialise.\\nDeepening the Economic and Monetary Union\\nWhile the euro area is now more robust than before the crisis, Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) needs to be strengthened, first and foremost by implementing what has already been agreed and finishing the common projects we have started: completing the banking union, strengthening the operational capacity of the European Stability Mechanism in full compliance with EU law, and making true the ambitious design of the capital markets union. We should also rekindle trust in our economic and fiscal framework by making it more effective in ensuring sound policymaking at the national level. At the European level, these actions are further supported by the envisaged budgetary instrument for convergence and competitiveness. However, like existing federations, the euro area will also need a central fiscal instrument to act countercyclically over time. A stable and resilient euro area economy that contributes to global economic growth and financial stability needs a more complete EMU.\\nThe global policy agenda\\nThe international environment continues to pose considerable risks, with the further escalation of trade tensions and rising geopolitical risks. Multilateral cooperation is needed to reduce trade frictions and mitigate risks of major disruptions to global economic activity and financial stability. Preserving openness is crucial if the global economy is to thrive and secure its growth potential.\\nWe must remain committed to implementing the agreed post-crisis regulatory reforms and evaluating their effects to ensure they are working as intended. It will be essential that we do not backtrack on the progress made during the crisis in strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework, and that a level playing field is preserved.\\nWhile progress has been made towards more resilient market-based finance worldwide, it is important to continue monitoring emerging risks and vulnerabilities in the financial system and to address them if necessary. In view of the potentially systemic nature of these risks, macroprudential frameworks also need to be extended beyond banking to ensure that authorities have the appropriate tools to act in a timely manner when needed.\\nWhile the first line of defence for national and international stability is to have sound domestic policies in place, the Global Financial Safety Net (GFSN) strongly supports global financial stability. The ECB sees a need for the GFSN to be further strengthened with a strong, quota-based and adequately resourced IMF at its centre, particularly in the face of escalating risks and high uncertainty. Recognising that an increase in IMF quotas is not possible at this time, the ECB would strongly welcome a substantial increase in the New Arrangements to Borrow as a second-best outcome towards ensuring that the Fund has adequate resources.\\nThe IMF's surveillance is a very valuable external check on national as well as regional policies. As regards financial surveillance and the forthcoming Financial Sector Assessment Program Review, the ECB would welcome an agreement for holding a regular euro area review at the same frequency as for jurisdictions with systemically important financial systems in the future.\\nAn important institutional factor for monetary and financial stability worldwide is central bank independence, combined with full accountability vis-\\xe0-vis the people and their elected representatives. Currently, central bank independence is being challenged in a number of large advanced and emerging market economies. It is therefore important to recall that a central bank's credibility and, ultimately, the successful fulfilment of its mandate hinge on its ability to choose the appropriate policies independently.\\nInnovations in payment systems\\nFinally, as regards innovations in payment systems, depending on their design, stablecoins may help overcome current shortcomings, especially in cross-border payments. At the same time, stablecoins can affect the conduct and transmission of monetary policy and may have implications for the functioning of the international monetary system. Global stablecoin arrangements now under discussion could impact the safety and efficiency of market infrastructures and payments or pose risks to financial stability. Stablecoin arrangements also raise challenges related to anti-money laundering and terrorist financing, consumer protection, data privacy and other issues. They must therefore be appropriately designed and operated in accordance with public policy objectives and they must comply with the relevant regulatory, oversight and prudential standards under the \"same business, same risk, same rules\" principle before they go live. Central banks should scale up ongoing efforts to foster the efficiency and inclusiveness of payment and financial services, in particular by improving cross-border payments and reviewing and updating the international call for action on financial inclusion, as well as by strengthening cooperation. Furthermore, they should continue to assess the pros and cons of issuing central bank digital currencies."

        "title": "Fran\\xe7ois Villeroy de Galhau: Causes of and answers to the European slowdown ",
        "content": "Accompanying slides of the speech.\\nLadies and Gentlemen, dear students,\\nI am very pleased to be with you today. Dear Thomas, both sides of the Atlantic benefit from your skills in economics. The high quality education you students receive here at the NYU Stern Business School will give you the tools to understand and address global challenges. In my introductory remarks today, I will address one of these, the current European slowdown, and quickly elaborate on 3 paradoxes: 1- the causes of the slowdown are mainly outside the euro area, but its effects are very acute on its biggest economy; 2 - the recent monetary policy controversy is of little interest for the future; 3 - the euro area has more policy room than others in the non-monetary domain, but under-uses it.\\n**\\nI. The causes of the slowdown are mainly outside the euro area, but its effects are very acute on the region's biggest economy\\nThe causes of the slowdown are mainly external to the euro area: uncertainty is undoubtedly the most important; it is mostly man-made, and must also be fixed by man. Due to the escalation of trade tensions we are witnessing a significant slowdown in global trade [Slide]: in its latest World Economic Outlook, the IMF expects the slowest global growth since 2008-2009 [Slide]. The loss of global growth due to the trade war could reach up to 0.8% next year, due mainly to its indirect effects, beyond tariffs: fall in business confidence and investment, decrease in productivity. Similarly, the twists and turns of Brexit have created volatility in UK quarterly growth, and weighed on business investment.\\nDespite this gloomy context, the French economy is resilient, with growth at 1.3% close to its potential. Purchasing power per capita should accelerate sharply in 2019 (2.3%), due to the strength of labour income - 1 million jobs have been created over the past four years - and the fiscal stimulus. But - as a whole - the euro area is acutely affected, primarily due to the weight of Germany - with growth of only 0.4% expected this year. Of course Germany is highly specialised in the manufacture of capital goods and \"overexposed\" to global trade - German exports account for around 50% of GDP. Combined with a radical upheaval of the car industry, these phenomenon nearly constitute an asymmetric shock for the German economy.\\nII. The recent monetary policy controversy is of little interest for the future\\nOver the past few years, monetary policy has played its full part in helping Europe weather the storm. Let me pay a warm tribute to the Captain of our vessel, Mario Draghi, as his term soon comes to an end. Thanks to Mario Draghi's leadership, we protected our most valuable asset, the euro, and kept our monetary union together. Thanks to his unswerving determination and readiness to do \"whatever it takes\", we are still all on board.\\nThanks to him, the Eurosystem has deployed a supportive and innovative monetary policy strategy. Over the past five years, the ECB has experimented with a variety of unconventional policy instruments, and it has arguably gone later but further into the toolbox than the Fed or the BoE. And the different instruments can influence different parts of the yield curve.\\nThis policy has been effective in supporting the recovery in the euro area since 2013. As a recent memorandum of the \"old guard\" apparently missed some positive outcomes of the last years, let me remind them: estimates of the effectiveness of the unconventional monetary policies implemented since 2013 have a broad range but are in the order of 2\\xbd percentage points on growth and 1-1\\xbd percentage points on inflation over the period 2015-2018. In times of heightened uncertainty, the recent strengthening of our forward guidance - which is now strongly \"state based\" - demonstrates our determination to reach our inflation target. We now expect rates to remain at their present levels of -0.5%, or lower, until the inflation outlook robustly converges to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2%, and this convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics. Besides, this strengthening of our forward guidance implies the consequent prolongation of the reinvestment period for the very important stock of QE assets - 2600 billion euros. The tiering system will help us mitigate the possible side effects that negative rates might have on banks' profitability, which is crucial to protect the transmission of our monetary policy through the bank-lending channel.\\nThe Governing Council's discussion at the start of September is now behind us; everyone has expressed themselves legitimately - I have explained my own reservations on one part of the package -; but the decisions were taken equally legitimately, and they provide clarity well into the future. Have no doubt: we are committed, and the whole package will be implemented. We must now look resolutely forward, with three strong elements of consensus around Mario Draghi today and Christine Lagarde tomorrow: we have to maintain an accommodative monetary policy in the face of the economic slowdown and low inflation. Second, a review of our monetary policy framework in this environment will be very welcome. And third, it is very desirable that fiscal policy now prolongs this monetary support, wherever that is possible in Europe. It is time to turn the page, and turn to the future.\\nIII. The euro area has more policy room than others in the non-monetary domain, but under-uses it.\\nMonetary policy can no longer be the only game in town. Central banks - including the ECB - cannot perform miracles. This paradox is either painful or promising-or both: the euro area has more leeway than the US or the UK, but until now has been much less inclined to use it. This has two dimensions [slide].\\n1/ The euro area has a lower level of public debt (85%) than in the United-States (104 %) or the UK (87%),  it has the lowest sovereign interest rates - even often negative -, but it uses fiscal stimulus significantly less. It should now exploit its fiscal leeway where available - especially in Germany - to support cyclical stabilisation, and long-term growth. There is also room to increase wages in countries which have full employment and external surpluses. And it is essential to choose quality expenditure, starting with investment. In this respect, I welcome the announced creation of a Dutch investment fund targeted to projects in infrastructure, digital, or climate transition. Its magnitude could be up to 7% of GDP: this is food for thought if we transpose this order of magnitude at the European level. Private debt - which stands at about 119% of GDP - is also significantly lower in the euro area compared to the US (148%), UK (152%) or Japan (152%). But of course, the \"lower for longer\" environment requires increased vigilance on financial stability. The IMF just stressed it in its latest \"radar\" in the GFSR [slide]. On both sides of the Atlantic, we should pay greater attention to non-banks and leveraged debt, and not be shy of activating macroprudential tools, and go beyond the old \"separation principle\" between monetary policy and financial stability: I advocate a smarter coordination1.\\n2/ Furthermore, the euro area has an abundant resource at its disposal: a savings surplus towards investment of more than 300 billion euros. The top priority on the European growth agenda should be a Union for Savings and Sustainable Investment to achieve two major objectives, as proposed by the \"Next CMU report\" published last week by the Ecofin Council: (i) offering saving products to serve citizens' needs and allocating capital to value creating investments in the real, innovating and sustainable economy; (ii) building/strengthening an integrated, competitive, deep and liquid European Capital Market, to maintain the EU as one of the top 2 financial centres of the world [slide]. To achieve this, it is now high time to give the Banking Union and the Capital Markets Union a significant push forward, let us at last, walk our talk!  \\n**\\nTo conclude, let me quote one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, Benjamin Franklin: \"we must, indeed, all hang together or, most assuredly, we shall all hang separately.\" Hanging together is exactly what we should aim for within Europe - to build a more integrated Union - and outside Europe - to work on a renewed multilateralism.\\n1 Cf. Speech at the Paris School of Economics, 24 September 2019."

        "title": "Dimitar Radev: Decision about the euro is strategic, not conjunctural",
        "content": "Mr. Radev, how would you assess the results of the asset quality review that the European Central Bank (ECB) conducted on six Bulgarian banks? How is the subsequent communication with Frankfurt in view of the goal of entering ERM II?\\nThe results are not surprising. They correspond to our own assessments. The communication with the ECB was and remains excellent both when it comes to the work related to the asset quality review and stress test, and when it comes to the overall process of preparing to join ERM II, the Single Supervisory Mechanism and the Single Resolution Mechanism.\\nBy definition, the parameters of such stress tests are markedly conservative. The ECB's approach, however, included some quite unlikely scenarios, such as increasing corporate tax to 30% in the next three years. This could be a negative development for countries like Greece with its 28% tax, or Spain with its 25%, but it seems unrealistic for Bulgaria with its 10%. Wasn't it logical for the European Banking Authority's methodology, which was developed for the stress tests on the largest Western European banks a year ago, to be adapted to the conditions in Bulgaria?\\nThe technical parameters in the methodology of the stress test's baseline and adverse scenario are the same as those applied across all the member states by the European Banking Authority. The effect of this specific scenario you are referring to on the balance of banks turned out to be negligible, which is why we did not have to seek corrective actions during our talks with the ECB.\\nThe new IFRS 9 accounting standard was applied in this review. According to experts like Assoc. Prof. Sariyski, this standard allows for more subjective models and does not provide for any arbitration that could resolve disputes between appraisers and those evaluated. Are such criticisms founded?\\nWe are talking about a new international standard that is mandatory for banks. Bulgarian banks were well-prepared for its introduction. This was also one of the main recommendations we made after the asset quality review in 2016. There are established platforms for discussing and amending existing, as well as adopting new international accounting standards.\\nBNB will have to start applying the measures and recommendations of the Single Supervisory Mechanism with the eventual entry into a \"close cooperation\" mechanism. What practical changes would this bring to the work of banking supervision?\\nThe changes are of a regulatory and administrative nature. A large part of them have been prepared already and we are ready for their introduction on the date of our effective accession. Under the close cooperation mechanism the ECB exercises direct supervision over the largest banks and there the BNB will be involved with the participation of BNB's experts in the supervisory teams. An ongoing active exchange of supervisory information will be established between us and the ECB concerning the other banks that will remain under BNB's direct supervision.\\nCountries like Hungary, Poland and especially the Czech Republic are markedly against joining the eurozone at this point. Is the currency board the main difference between them and Bulgaria which explains this discrepancy between policies, or are there other factors at play?\\nThis is a political decision, above all. What's positive in our case is that this decision is based on strategic and not conjunctural considerations. Practically, there isn't a serious political factor in our country that does not support this decision. On the technical level, the monetary regime in Bulgaria allows for its implementation to happen quicker and seamlessly.\\nYou said in an interview for Market News this spring that the downturn in Europe could turn out to be temporary, but that would remain to be seen. How would you comment the developments in recent months?\\nUncertainty is on the rise and a lot of current data indicates a continuing economic downturn in the eurozone. This motivates the ECB to make decisions for an even more stimulating monetary policy. The technical details and the degree to which the ECB decided to step up its policy are a subject of debate, but the basic macroeconomic motivation behind these decisions is clear, in principle.\\nResponding to a question by Investor.bg, BNB says that given the lev's fixed exchange rate, delaying the entry into ERM II cannot create direct financial and macroeconomic risks for the Bulgarian economy. Could the opposite happen, however? Is it possible for ERM II membership to be negative for Bulgaria if it comes during unfavourable times for the European economy? To put it in different words, should we be in a hurry for the eurozone or should this goal be consistent with the conditions and trends for the time being?\\nWe should follow our strategic plan with a focus on the quality of the process. Due to the nature of our monetary regime, based on a fixed exchange rate, as well as our firm commitment to not change it until country's eurozone accession, our currency being part of ERM II will not lead to any changes in our macroeconomic position. The direct effects will be rather positive, such as increasing Bulgaria's credit rating and improving the overall investment environment.\\nSpanish economist Daniel Lacalle told Bloomberg TV Bulgaria in an interview that he believes the ECB's policy of stimulation has long exhausted its efficiency and the only thing it is currently doing is to transfer funds from productive to non-productive sectors of the economy. Lacalle also recalls that negative interest rates have played a significant role in Japan's difficulties with inflation and growth. What's your opinion? Is there a risk for the eurozone to get into the Japanese scenario?\\nThe global economic environment is far from being conventional. In that sense, the ECB's response with unconventional measures is completely logical. When unconventional measures are applied, it is normal to have different views about their effect, including the possibility of a \"Japanese\" scenario. It would be wrong, however, to put the focus solely on monetary policy without taking into account what is being or not being done to address the global economic uncertainty, and also in the areas of structural reforms and fiscal policy.\\nYou have said many times that in order to be effective, the politicians' attempts to stimulate the economy must be aimed at structural areas, like the labour market, pension reforms and education. What room for action do Bulgarian politicians have when these three areas are concerned? Do you believe that there are unused opportunities?\\nSuch opportunities exist, but they are associated with complex and sometimes time-consuming measures. They are not limited only to the labour market, pension reforms and education, but also extend to areas like health care, defence, the modernization of the technical and social infrastructure. Some steps in these fields require serious public resources. It is a good sign that they are implemented within an overall disciplined fiscal framework.\\nQuite a few economists say that the 2% inflation goal, set by the ECB, is a thing of the past given the ageing population and structurally transforming technologies. Do you believe there are grounds to correct this goal?\\nThere are grounds to conduct a strategic review of the monetary policy's goals. The last time this was done was back in 2003. There are expectations that the new ECB leadership will initiate such a review.\\nWhat effect do the low interest rates have on the Bulgarian economy?\\nThe immediate effect is positive. The increased credit activity is one of the indicators for this. Such a development, however, is connected with some serious challenges, for Instance the profitability of the banks as a result of the diminishing interest margins. I should say that so far the Bulgarian banks manage to deal with this challenge. Cyclical risks are also accumulating, due to which BNB activated and subsequently increased the level of the countercyclical capital buffer for banks.\\nIn recent years we have seen a few large deals in the Bulgarian banking system. Do you expect the consolidation to continue in the future? Is it a completely positive phenomenon?\\nConsolidation is one of the possible responses to the challenges facing the banks. I expect this process to continue."

        "title": "Egil Matsen: US Senate Democrats' Special Committee on the climate crisis",
        "content": "Chairman Schatz, I thank you for inviting Norges Bank, together with other NGFS-member central banks, to the U.S. Senate Democrats' Special Committee on the Climate Crisis. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss climate-related economic and financial risks and relevant central bank strategies to address those risks.\\nNorges Bank's mission is to promote economic stability by conducting monetary policy and monitoring the financial system. Our central bank also has the responsibility for managing Norway's SWF, the Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG), in accordance with a mandate issued by the Ministry of Finance. A feature common to both of these mandated responsibilities is the identification and management of risk. In addressing these risks, we should always work within our mandates. For central banks that means taking a comprehensive view of factors impacting the economy and the risks we face, while upholding market neutrality and preserving our independence.\\nClimate risk, the economy and financial stability\\nThe scientific basis for climate change is widely accepted. The physical impacts of climate change and measures to mitigate its impact, will affect all parts of the economy and have consequences for the financial system. Consequently, climate risk is a relevant consideration for central banks. There is a large degree of uncertainty among market participants about the magnitude and the timing of climate change, and about likely policy responses. This type of uncertainty may be a source of market failure.\\nClimate risk is a complex topic covering a broad field of issues being to a large degree outside the remit of central banks. Climate change is a global challenge. The prime responsibility and the most effective tools to mitigate climate risk lie with governments and with fiscal policy. It is important to use the market mechanism by pricing emissions to reflect the true costs of greenhouse gas emissions. However, the financial system must adapt to climate risk. Central banks and financial supervisory authorities can, within their mandates, promote financial stability by ensuring that financial institutions appropriately includes climate risk in their risk management. Climate risk is not fundamentally different from other risks facing the financial sector. Other types of risks may also be systemic and characterized by historical data having uncertain relevance for future risks. Both financial institutions and authorities must consider how a changing climate will affect financial risks. This must be integrated in the risk assessment and hence in the overall assessment of the capitalization and funding of financial institutions\\nUncertainty with respect to the magnitude and impact of climate change can lead to simplified assessments of its risks. Authorities, including central banks, may contribute to a knowledge-based debate and reduce uncertainty by strengthening and refining reporting requirements. A common basis of information and analysis may facilitate assessment and comparison of climate risk in individual institutions, and lead to a more correct pricing of risk. International cooperation could be fruitful in this work, including in the NGFS context.\\nResponsible investment at Norges Bank\\nIn its role as the GPFG's owner, the Norwegian Ministry of Finance specifies the investment universe, benchmark index, risk limits, and requirements. Norges Bank shall make investment decisions and exercise ownership rights independently of the Ministry. Within this framework, Norges Bank works on climate risk across the GPFG's three asset classes - listed equities, listed bonds, and unlisted real estate - within a general framework of objectives. By end-June 2019, the total market value of the fund was close to USD 1.1 trillion, corresponding to more than three times mainland GDP of Norway. The United States is by far the greatest receiver of funds, amounting to 41 percent of the total. To spread risks and capture global growth, the assets were invested in over 9,000 companies in more than 70 countries. We benefit from free and open markets that enable an efficient global allocation of resources.\\nThe objective is to achieve the highest possible return with acceptable risk. Responsible investment supports this in two ways. First, it seeks to improve the long-term economic performance of the investments. Second, it seeks to reduce the financial risks associated with Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) practices of companies in the portfolio. As such, the focus is on material ESG issues that impact the fund's long-term performance. These issues are captured in three responsible investment pillars.\\nFirst, establishing principles: A set of international principles and standards from the UN and the OECD provides a framework for the Bank's work with companies and other stakeholders. Priorities are based on the mandate and are characterised by formulating expectations of companies, guidelines for voting, and positions on governance issues. Documents communicate the Bank's priorities and ensure predictability.\\nSecond, active ownership: Voting at annual general meetings is the most important tool for active ownership. Through its voting, the Bank seeks to strengthen governance, improve financial performance and promote responsible investment practices. The voting guidelines provide a principled basis for voting decisions, but also take account of company-specific factors. In the Bank's dialogue with the largest companies, governance and sustainability topics relevant to long-term return are raised. This includes risks and opportunities associated with climate change, and the Bank expects companies to integrate material climate risks into their strategies, risk management and reporting.\\nThird, investing sustainably: The Ministry of Finance has given us dedicated environment-related mandates. Going forward, these mandates will include investments in unlisted infrastructure for renewable energy. Next, in certain cases we divest from companies that impose substantial costs on other agents, with the aim of reducing the fund's exposure to unacceptable risks. Finally, our political authorities provide guidelines that specifies that certain investments should be excluded from the fund due to ethical concerns. These exclusions include companies responsible for large-scale environmental damages, and companies whose business models relies heavily on thermal coal. .\\nSpecific central bank challenges in policy portfolio management\\nAside from the GPFG, Norges Bank, as other central banks, also manages policy portfolios. The Bank's foreign exchange reserves amounted to USD 64 billion at end-June 2019, divided into a 80% fixed-income portfolio and a 20% equity portfolio. The equity portion is invested in around 1,500 companies worldwide, with a focus on the larger markets and currencies, and managed according to similar principles governing responsible investment in the GPFG.\\nThe investment of the major part of the FX reserves is to a high degree determined by our central banking policy objectives. Consequently, we face specific challenges in any extension of responsible investment practices. First, this relates to respecting our legal policy mandate in the investment of our FX portfolio. Second, our investments must take due account of liquidity needs for monetary and financial stability purposes, as well as international financial commitments to the IMF. Third, we need to be vigilant to safeguarding independence and preventing conflicts of interest. And finally, while we are a transparent central bank, we need to strike a considered balance between transparency and remaining needs of confidentiality, to avoid undermining our primary policy objective.\\nInternational cooperation\\nTo conclude, like in other policy areas, there is a crucial role to play for international cooperation also in the field of climate risk. Norges Bank became a member of the NGFS in December 2018. The primary objective of this network is to create an arena for central banks and financial supervisors to exchange experiences and share best practices in developing environment and climate risk management in the financial sector. We consider this network to be an important meeting place to arrive at a well-considered understanding of the role and activities of central banks in this field."

        "content": "Chairman Schatz, Members of the Committee:\\nThank you for inviting me to this important meeting with central bankers. The Bundesbank is a proud founding member of the NGFS, the Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System.\\nThe work being done by the NGFS demonstrates that combating climate change is a key factor for the financial system.\\nClimate change can have long-term impacts on economic structures and activities, productivity and other key macro variables, such as prices. Even if mitigation strategies are put in place, societies and economies are likely to face increasing climate change-related disruptions and supply-side shocks. Apart from climate change itself, policy responses will affect macroeconomic activities as well, with implications for the financial system.\\nWe therefore look at climate change as a source of financial risk, both from the micro- and the macroprudential perspective. The U.S. Senate Democrats' Special Committee on the Climate Crisis also made this strong point in its letter to the Fed. As Frank Elderson from De Nederlandsche Bank has already covered the banking supervisory perspective, I would like to focus on financial stability.\\nFrom a financial stability perspective, the Bundesbank has a clear mandate to take into account a potentially systemic impact of climate-related risks on the financial system.\\nIn this regard, we need a sound understanding of how physical and transition risks arising from climate change affect financial stability. To achieve this understanding, we need more data on individual and systemic climate risk exposures, prudent methods of measuring vulnerabilities to climate risks, and analytical frameworks with longer horizons.\\nAt present it is not entirely clear to what extent market participants adequately price climate-related risks.\\nIf the general market assessment changes, for example as a result of a natural disaster or unexpectedly drastic policy measures, this could have a significant impact on market dynamics.\\nIf many market participants sell at the same time, this could rapidly drive down the prices of affected assets, with spill-overs to other financial market segments.\\nThe result could be a broad decline in asset prices, with repercussions for the entire financial system. While such a chain reaction cannot be ruled out entirely, its probability and impact are difficult to estimate. At the same time, we must stay alert to the potential risk of \"green bubbles\". Green investments are not automatically risk-free.\\nTo conclude: The general objective of regulation and supervision is to preserve and to improve individual and systemic resilience against financial risk.\\nTherefore, any regulatory changes suggested in the context of sustainable / green finance need to follow a risk-based approach.\\nWe in the NGFS are developing an analytical framework in order to quantify and assess the impact of climate-related risks on the economy and the financial system.\\nThis will further strengthen our ability to safeguard financial stability and effectively supervise banks - which is why I look forward to paving the way for a greener, more sustainable financial system."

        "title": "Michelle W Bowman: Opening remarks - \"Monetary Policy's Impact on Workers and Their Communities\"  ",
        "content": "Thank you, President Evans, for hosting this event today, and to our moderator and participants for taking part in this valuable discussion. Today's event is the last in our series of Fed Listens events held across the country to learn about how Americans think about monetary policy and how they think about the Federal Reserve.\\nIn keeping with the purpose of Fed Listens, I would like to spend most of our time in conversation. But I do want to offer a few thoughts about why the Fed is reaching out to seek a broad range of views, and what we are hoping to accomplish through this initiative.\\nFed Listens is a new comprehensive outreach to the public on monetary policy. For many decades there was a sense at the Board that the public wasn't interested or even willing to dive into the complexities of monetary policy. That view has changed in a fundamental way, especially in the aftermath of the financial crisis when it was urgently important that the public understand what we were doing. So we began explaining as accessibly and as clearly as we could what we were doing and why. Now we are listening carefully.\\nSince I became a Board member almost a year ago, it has become clear to me that people are not only willing to engage on complex economic issues, but they also want to know that their concerns are being taken into consideration on issues that affect their financial well-being. The Fed's movement toward greater transparency and public engagement is well underway, and advancing that effort is one of my top priorities.\\nAt the same time, we recognize that the clear communication of our policies actually helps us achieve our goals. When we communicate our views on the economic outlook and our expectations for where interest rates may be heading, consumers and businesses take that information into account when making decisions on spending, investment, and hiring. For that reason, our policy communications are an important part of the Fed's toolkit for influencing the direction of the economy.\\nFed Listens is a natural outcome of this commitment to public engagement. We have heard from many people from different parts of the country and from different sectors of the economy about how monetary policy affects them and their communities. It is our responsibility as a public institution to be accountable to the public. Hearing a broad range of perspectives on these issues will help us make good decisions as we consider new approaches to monetary policy.\\nAs I mentioned before, this afternoon's discussion is the last in a series of Fed Listens events that we began back in February. Looking at the depth of experience of our panelists and of David Wessel, our distinguished moderator, I think we can make a strong case that we saved the best for last. Our first panel focuses on disadvantaged workers' long-term job prospects. I am eager to hear from our panelists how they think the labor market and our policies are impacting the communities they serve in Illinois, Michigan, and in other states in the Midwest.\\nAs a former community banker, I am also very interested to hear from people who are implementing creative strategies to build wealth and support access to credit for low- and moderate-income communities. The panelists in our second session can speak to their experiences doing just that, because they are helping to bring credit and housing opportunities to Appalachia, Indianapolis as well as right here in Chicago.\\nOur monetary policy review will have implications for financial markets, but we also want to know more about what the impact will be on Main Street. My colleagues and I are keenly aware of our responsibility to focus on how the decisions we make affect the real economy for people in communities all across the country.\\nThe two goals for monetary policy-maximum employment and stable prices-are determined by the Congress and are not subject to our framework review. How we reach those goals is the topic for discussion. One question I hope to explore is whether we need new strategies to more effectively achieve our goals. For example, inflation has run modestly below our 2 percent objective for many years. Given that, it would be helpful to hear whether you think the Federal Open Market Committee should consider strategies that aim to have inflation exceed our target for a period of time to make up for the earlier shortfall or whether you think that would threaten the decades of success the Fed has had keeping the public's inflation expectations low and stable.\\nAnother question concerns the Fed's existing toolkit for monetary policy. Currently, our available policy tools include setting interest rates, purchasing longer-term assets, and forward guidance about the expected future path of policy. Are there other tools we should consider to help us reach and sustain our objectives more effectively? I also want to know how the Federal Open Market Committee's communication of its policy framework might be improved. How can we help you better understand our work so you can hold us accountable?\\nYour perspectives on questions like these are a vital part of this monetary policy review. So I want to thank you again for your time and your contributions. Once the policy review is complete, we will share our findings with the public, probably during the first half of next year. I look forward to our discussion."

I want to thank our hosts, the European Central Bank, who put so much work into making this conference a success, as well as the conference organizers from all three sponsoring institutions-the ECB, Federal Reserve, and the Bank of England. I also want to express my appreciation to the many researchers from universities and from other central banks, as well as the members of women's and minority committees of economics and finance associations from around the world, who are attending the conference in Frankfurt. I wish that I could have been there with you to participate in the discussions.\\nI found the conference program to be particularly interesting, and I look forward to Federal Reserve staff coming back to Washington to share what they learned from the research and discussions. At the Federal Reserve, we greatly value this conference, not only for the interactions that our staff have while they are there, but also when they bring back what they learn and share it with our staff. Last year, we had over 200 staff members from across the organization attend summary presentations in DC given by several staff members who had attended the conference in London. In fact, staff in Washington had a \"watch party\" to view the webcast of today's panels. The topics of today's conference, including papers on the promotion of women, the role of culture and institutions, and the dynamics of publishing, conferences, and seminars, will all spur additional conversations and ideas for action among staff at the Federal Reserve.\\nIn my view, central banks have a responsibility to be leaders in addressing diversity and inclusion, not only for our own institutions, but also because of our influence on the profession as a whole. Part of the value of this conference is that we, as central banks, can promote the study of these issues and discuss concrete steps that we can take together to address them.\\nCertainly, we take diversity and inclusion issues to heart at the Federal Reserve.1 We believe that the best ideas, policies and, ultimately, service to the public are the result of diverse perspectives, and from a staff that reflects the rich diversity of our nation. Inclusion makes us stronger by providing all employees the assurance that they will be working in an environment that welcomes and values their differences, and that recognizes and rewards people according to the contributions they make in advancing the mission of the organization. That is not to say that we have all of the solutions, or that we do not have considerable progress to make. But we have made efforts in a number of areas. These efforts are consistent with the Congressional directive to establish the Office of Minority and Women Inclusion, and as articulated in the Board of Governors' Strategic Plan for Diversity and Inclusion.2\\nFirst, we have made a commitment, and have made progress, to make our institution more diverse. That includes efforts to bring greater diversity to the Board of Directors of our Federal Reserve Banks and Branches as well as to senior leadership in the Federal Reserve System. We have also worked to improve our internal culture. These efforts include re-establishing and strengthening employee resource groups. We are working to come up with codes of conduct including efforts to make our meetings more inclusive and set rules around behavior in seminars. We are also providing diversity and inclusion as well as bystander training to both new and existing employees.\\nSecond, we have broadened our reach in recruiting to provide a more diverse range of applicants the opportunity to apply for positions at the Federal Reserve-through strengthening our connections to schools that serve diverse populations, hiring an outreach specialist for these communities, establishing a stronger presence at career fairs for diverse students, and hosting career events for students to promote jobs in economics and finance at the Federal Reserve.\\nThird, we are working with high schools and universities to inspire students' interest in economics and finance. We are also working to provide them with the tools they need to enter these fields. This has included partnerships with local high schools to teach economics, and with a local Historically Black University, Howard University, to teach and mentor students in economics and statistical analysis. This last initiative has led to students developing an interest and pursuing careers in economics, including as research assistants at the Federal Reserve, and several are currently employed at the Board as research assistants.\\nOf course, these conferences are also an important part of addressing diversity and inclusion in central banking, and the economics and finance professions. I look forward to welcoming all of you to Washington next fall to attend the third such conference, hosted by the Federal Reserve. We hope these conferences will inspire further work on these important topics and will highlight the issues that researchers are addressing, and more broadly promote the conversations we are having in the economic and finance professions.\\nThank you for your work, and I look forward to seeing you at the Federal Reserve next year.\\n1 1.

        "content": "I would like to thank the Financial Stability Unit for their contributions to this speech, and particularly E. Rocher and S. Frappa.\\nA little over ten years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and with the financial system facing new challenges, how successful have the reforms undertaken after the 2008 crisis been? Is the financial system now safer? In view of the magnitude of the work carried out by regulators and supervisors and the efforts of intermediaries to adapt to the resulting renewed regulatory and supervisory framework, at the international, European and national levels, the answer is undoubtedly yes. I would like to devote the first part of my presentation to developing the reasons why I believe this is the case. But I think we need to take a more in-depth look, which I propose to do in the second part of my presentation by asking the following question: is the financial system now safe enough? In view of the development of the sources of vulnerabilities in the financial system, it does not seem to me to be a given that the strengthening we have observed is sufficient and efforts therefore need to be pursued.\\n1. Ten years after Lehman Brothers, the financial system is now safer\\nThe crisis that followed the Lehman collapse demonstrated the importance of a sound financial system that could withstand shocks without hampering the financing of the economy. The economies that, after a macroeconomic shock, suffer a financial shock because their banking sector is too fragile, experience more serious and protracted crises. This lesson led to a vast reform programme of financial system regulation and supervision in order to address the many shortcomings that led to the development of significant vulnerabilities.\\n1.1 MANY OF THE SHORTCOMINGS IN THE REGULATORY AND SUPERVISORY FRAMEWORK HAVE BEEN REDUCED\\nA comprehensive reform was thus carried out, covering practically all the areas of the financial system, focusing on four main areas:\\n(a) Shoring up the resilience of financial institutions\\nFor banks, under the impetus of the G20 and the Financial Stability Board (FSB), the Basel Committee has established new prudential rules, \"Basel III\", whose main features aim to enhance the level and quality of capital, limit the use of financial leverage and introduce new liquidity requirements. These rules must ensure that banks are able to cope with short-term pressures on their refinancing and regulate their transformation activity. Lastly, the framework introduces for the first time a \"macroprudential\" component, consisting of a countercyclical capital buffer and a surcharge for global systemically important banks (additional capital and leverage ratio).\\nMost G20 jurisdictions have adopted this framework. In Europe, the Capital Requirements Regulation and the Capital Requirements Directive (CRR and CRD) transpose the Basel III agreement. When transposing this agreement, Europe also added additional components: a systemic risk buffer, \"Pillar 2 capital measures\" to cover risks not covered or not sufficiently covered by regulations (interest rate risk, governance risk, etc.), requirements on remuneration policies and practices, etc.\\nFor the insurance sector, a harmonised prudential framework has been applied in Europe since 2016: Solvency II introduced the principle of risk-based regulation, and quantitative capital requirements have been significantly increased.\\nBeyond the regulatory framework alone the institutional framework has been strengthened in many countries. Macroprudential authorities have been set up (as in France, as of 2010) to ensure the stability of the financial system as a whole and to facilitate coordination between the various supervisors. In Europe, the creation of the three supervisory authorities (2011) has enabled progress to be made in the adoption of a Single Rulebook. Lastly, in the euro area, the introduction of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) in 2014 has allowed us to bring our prudential supervision of the banking sector in line with best practices.\\n(b) Put an end to \"too big to fail\", i.e. ensure that, in the future, a failing bank, even a large one, will no longer have to be bailed out by public funds. Since 2009, these institutions qualified as Systemically Important Financial Institutions (SIFIs) have been defined as those whose \"disorderly failure, due to their size, complexity and systemic interconnection, would cause significant disruption to the financial system as a whole and to economic activity\". Banks designated as systemic at the global level by the FSB, and in France at the national level by the ACPR, are subject to enhanced supervision measures. In addition to the capital surcharges already mentioned, systemic banks must comply with specific requirements for the preparation of recovery plans to deal with crises. A resolution strategy could be implemented if recovery measures prove insufficient. This plan could include the use of bail-in mechanisms.\\n(c) Making OTC derivatives markets safer: the 2008 financial crisis demonstrated the strength of market infrastructures. In particular, central counterparties (CCPs) have held up well. These entities play a very specific operational role in ensuring the successful settlement of securities transactions or the execution of derivative contracts by acting as an intermediary between counterparties. As a result, they are key players in the financial system. The very cautious risk management applied by CCPs and the existence of mechanisms to handle the defaults of their participants limit contagion phenomena. The resilience of CCPs has led international regulators to: (i) confirm their central role in controlling risks in the financial system, with multilateral clearing by CCPs being considered safer than bilateral clearing between participants. This has resulted in an extension of the clearing obligation to all standardised OTC derivatives; (ii) improve their resilience by further strengthening their risk management framework, as the concentration of clearing among a small number of entities requires a particularly robust framework.\\nThe principles applicable to financial market infrastructures have also been strengthened, with the publication in 2012 of the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructure (PFMI). This is still the reference text for market infrastructure regulation today. In Europe, these PFMI were translated into hard law through the European market infrastructure regulation (EMIR), which was adopted in 2014 and is applicable to CCPs and central trade repositories.\\n(d) Better regulate the non-bank financial system to enable sound market financing: the aim is to strengthen supervision of shadow banking as the financial crisis showed that the accumulation of risks on the periphery of the banking system, sometimes without effective oversight, could have devastating effects.         \\nWe now have a better understanding of the non-bank financial system, thanks to the FSB's mapping work, which makes it possible to measure its developments and the risks associated with it. The FSB has also worked to strengthen investment fund regulations to better manage liquidity risk - recent episodes of massive capital outflows by UK and French funds have demonstrated the importance of managing this risk well - and leverage risk. With regard to money market funds, European regulations have made it possible to strengthen their resilience to the risk of a sudden and massive investor retrenchment, and increased liquidity and transparency requirements have been in place since January 2018. Securitisation, which in 2008 may have appeared to be a factor for crisis propagation (via subprime lending), has been subject to new prudential rules, making it possible to better mitigate its risks while promoting the sound development of this instrument. The new European framework creates a label to identify high quality securitisation transactions, which meet the criteria for simplicity, transparency and standardisation (STS label).\\n1.2 THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE REGULATORY CHANGES COMBINED WITH FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES'EFFORTS TO ADAPT, HAVE GENERATED TANGIBLE SIGNS OF INCREASED FINANCIAL SYSTEM RESILIENCE.\\nFor the financial system, I would like to give three examples:\\n(a) Significant improvement in the solvency and liquidity of banks    \\nThe own funds of major French banks have almost tripled since the crisis. Their Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratios increased from 5.8% to 13.6% between 2008 and 2018. European banks have improved their short-term liquidity ratios, catching up with or even outstripping their international peers as from 2015. The long-term liquidity ratio for European banks is changing more slowly but, at the end of 2018, stood at around 110%, a level higher than that required under Basel rules.\\nAs regards insurance, the introduction of Solvency II has also resulted in an overall increase in the own funds of European insurers.\\n(b) Balance sheet consolidation and a reduction in NPLs\\nContinuing high levels of non-performing loans in some euro area countries pose a number of problems, since they constrain banks' profitability and generate provisioning needs that weigh on the level of own funds, and even a viability risk for the most fragile banks.\\nBut since the introduction of the SSM, large European banks have overall significantly reduced their outstanding NPLs. This outstanding amount reached EUR 587 billion in March 2019, compared with over EUR 1,000 billion at the end of 2014. French banks, for their part, have always outperformed their European peers: their NPL ratio has always been below the European average, now standing at 2.8% (against 3.1% for the EU). Furthermore, French banks consistently displayed an NPL coverage ratio of more than 50% over the December 2009-June 2019 period, well above the 45% average for European banks.\\n(c) Results of the recent stress tests\\nPrudential stress tests are simulation exercises designed to assess the impact of a given economic and financial scenario on an institution's prudential situation, in order to test its financial soundness. During the crisis, they were first used as a crisis management tool to identify the most vulnerable banks for which recapitalisation measures were needed. Their role then evolved into an essential and flexible tool for the supervision, oversight and management of risks and vulnerabilities of banks considered individually (microprudential supervision) as well as for financial stability purposes (macroprudential supervision).\\nStress tests have thus contributed to an increased resilience of the financial system: (i) Stress tests shore up banks' capital positions by serving as a basis for calculating additional capital requirements (\"Pillar 2 Guidance\" or P2G); (ii) the publication of individual stress test results, which is accompanied by the disclosure of individual bank data, ensures transparency and enhances market discipline; (iii) regular stress test exercises under the aegis of the supervisory authority encourage banks to develop their internal risk management processes and information tools.\\nThe comparison over time of the aggregate results of the stress tests conducted by the EBA and the ECB testifies to the increased soundness of European banks. In the event of an adverse scenario, the 2018 stress test showed that the banks' solvency ratio would be 9.9%, i.e. 100 basis points higher than the level obtained by the stress test conducted in 2016.\\nHowever, we must be careful not to become complacent: risks are increasing and, while some recent events have confirmed the relevance of the instruments deployed (see in particular the H2O incident), the fact that they ultimately proved benign does not mean that in a stressed market environment the outcome would not be less favourable. It is therefore vital to continue to shore up the resilience of the financial system\\n2. We should not take it for granted that the financial system has been sufficiently reinforced\\n2.1 VULNERABILITIES ARE EVOLVING AN INCREASING\\nGlobal macroeconomic risks have increased markedly. World growth is slowing and is overshadowed by major uncertainties. According to the latest forecasts, world GDP should expand by 3.0% in 2019, down from 3.8% growth last year (IMF), largely as a result of the slowdown in emerging countries, especially China, and to a lesser extent in certain advanced economies. In the euro area, our forecasts are for 1.1% growth in 2019, down from 1.9% in 2018. The main uncertainties weighing on growth are the risks of an escalation in protectionist measures and of a no-deal Brexit which could lead to a tightening of financial conditions in Europe.\\nThe rising tendency in macroeconomic risk is helping to maintain and reinforce accommodative monetary policies, as well as the \"low-for-long\" direction of and expectations for interest rates.\\nThis low interest rate environment is fuelling an increase in household and corporate debt, in both advanced and emerging economies. In France, private sector debt reached 132.3% of GDP at end-2018 (+45 percentage points since 2000). Household debt has risen by 8 percentage points of GDP since the end of the crisis (59.8% of GDP).\\nIn Europe, bank profitability is coming under increasing pressure from a number of risks:\\nThe first of these is the maintenance of a low interest rate environment for a long time. This is not just the fault of the central banks: an accommodative monetary policy is justified in light of the euro area's economic situation; but beyond this, low long rates also reflect a structural weakness in growth. What is more, monetary policy and low rates also have positive effects for banks, such as a reduction in their cost of risk and increase in their lending volumes. However, the fact remains that the current environment is compressing net interest margins for retail banks, which finance themselves with deposits - and not at variable rates in the markets - and is lowering returns on insurers' investments.\\nThe second risk, which is more structural, is the digital transformation of finance, which is revolutionising modes of use and bringing significant benefits to customers. However, adapting to this change requires huge investment by banks, to adjust their information systems and develop new, personalised service offerings. The digital transformation is also putting downward pressure on revenues due to increased competition from new market entrants (neobanks, GAFA, etc.). In response to this, financial institutions need to unleash new productivity gains, by exploring even further the possibilities of automation and artificial intelligence (AI), and adapting their branch networks on all levels (size, , density).\\nThe digital transition is also leading to a rising threat of cyber risk and, more broadly, operational risks (large-scale theft, data corruption), to which financial institutions are more than ever exposed.\\nLast, financial intermediaries also have to adapt to a new imperative - the need to take account of the risks linked to climate change, which I shall come back to later.\\n2.2 TO CONSOLIDATE THE RESILIENCE OF THE RESILIENCE OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM, WE THEREFORE NEED TO COMPLETE THE PROGRAMME OF REFORMS AND ADAPT IT TO THE NEW RISKS\\n2.2.1. \"Finish the job\": complete the programme of reforms and ensure its coordinated implementation at the global level.\\n(a) Finish the implementation of Basel III. On 7 December 2017, the Basel Committee adopted an important accord finalising the Basel III framework. The text completes the overhaul of the international prudential framework begun in 2009, by notably allowing financial institutions to continue using internal models, subject to strict conditions. This accord will gradually be rolled out as of 2022 with full implementation scheduled for 2027.\\nIn the EU, the transposition of the Basel accords will result in a modification of the Capital Requirements Regulation and Directive (CRR3/CDR6). The Commission has already begun this legal work by asking the EBA to analyse the impact of the reforms on the European banking industry and economy.\\nThe Banque de France and ACPR support the principle of a full and faithful application of the Basel accords within the EU. This implementation has to be reciprocal and must be harmonised at the international level. This is a prerequisite for ensuring the stability of the global banking system, and for guaranteeing a level playing field among banks. The implementation will also need to take account of the specificities of the European economic and financial environment.\\n(b) Finalise the adoption of a European resolution framework for CCPs and insurers\\nThe resolution of CCPs is the last major topic on the FSB's work programme. By reinforcing the central role of CCPs in the markets, the new framework risks creating entities that are \"too big to fail\": it is important therefore that we have tools to handle CCP crises efficiently, without resorting to a state bail-out that would ultimately leave taxpayers bearing the cost of default. As a result, after having set out strong expectations in 2017, the FSB is currently refining an international CCP resolution framework, which will be enshrined in a new European regulation.\\nIn insurance, France is one of the first EU Member States to have put in place a recovery and resolution regime for insurers with the Sapin 2 Law of 9 December 2016. The Order of 27 November 2017 also gave the ACPR's Resolution College the power to start resolution proceedings for failing insurers and take steps to maintain their critical functions or safeguard financial stability. The framework comprises a preventive arm, under which the largest insurers are obliged to draw up preventive recovery plans. At the European level, there is currently no shared approach to the resolution of insurers. However, there is clearly a need for such a framework to facilitate the resolution of insurers, in particular cross-border groups, and help strengthen the European insurance market for the benefit of policyholders\\n(c) Finally, and most of all in my view, it is also \"time for macroprudential policy\". The numerous instruments developed since the crisis should now be put to work in preserving financial stability. This is what is being done in France, for example, with the gradual activation of countercyclical capital buffers or measures limiting the exposures of the main banks to large, highly indebted corporations.\\n2.2.2. Adapt the framework to new risks \\nIn addition to applying the regulatory standards, the supervisor is also, of course, paying close attention to how business models evolve, in order to identify emerging risks, monitor them and devise possible solutions.\\nSeveral new areas of risk are coming under particular scrutiny:\\nWith regard to cyber risk, the planned solutions, especially to increase cyber resilience, need to be harmonised and coordinated at the international level to maintain a clear and coherent regulatory framework for all financial sector participants. The Banque de France made the rationalisation and harmonisation of current regulatory efforts a key theme of its G7 presidency this year. As part of this, 23 global authorities (finance ministries, central banks, bank supervisors and markets) took part in a cyber resilience exercise in June 2019, with the aim of strengthening their operational resilience to a major cyber incident impacting the global financial system. The exercise, which was by nature highly complex and the first of its kind in the world, marked a huge step forward in terms of global cooperation. Thanks to its success, G7 countries agreed to draw up a programme of exercises for the coming years.\\nThe FinTechs and BigTechs (especially the big US and Asian companies that are driving the digitalisation of the economy) offer new opportunities (new cyber security solutions, reduction in the cost of internal management for client entities, increase in financial inclusion, etc.), but are equally a source of additional vulnerabilities, notably in terms of cyber risk, the weakening of financial ecosystems and the development of questionable practices in the use of data. The Banque de France is working actively on these issues within international and European fora, to promote the sharing of experiences and harmonisation of rules and practices, and encourage efforts to make financial sector agents more resilient.\\nWe also need to continue assessing the reforms already put in place, to check that they deliver the expected effects and to identify any unintended consequences. The FSB's assessment shows that although certain measures have largely been implemented - requirements for systemically important institutions, clearing - other aspects still have to be finalised, notably with regard to the monitoring of non-banking financial institutions. Only when these reforms are fully implemented will the financial system be effectively protected.\\nThe European integration projects are also essential for increasing the EU's macroeconomic resilience. First we need to finalise Banking Union on an institutional level. One positive contribution would be to work towards a European deposit guarantee scheme. This could be based, at least initially, on covering liquidity requirements, with no permanent transfers between Member States. We also need to ensure the harmonised application of banking regulations in all Banking Union countries, and avoid the risk of fragmentation, which would reduce the expected benefits of a union. It is also vital to strengthen the integration of European financial markets. The action plan for the Capital Markets Union, launched by the Commission in 2015, has allowed a few advances to be made, with the creation of European cross-border funds and a pan-European retirement savings product. We must go even further on this, and create a genuine Financing Union for Investment and Innovation, that would better channel Europe's savings surplus (3% of GDP) towards productive investment, by shoring up companies' capital and increasing their ability to develop and innovate.  For this, we need to (i) facilitate cross-border investment by harmonising accounting, tax and bankruptcy rules; (ii) develop incentives for equity financing; (iii) develop European securities and savings products (venture capital funds, green bonds, securitised portfolios, etc.) aimed at providing long-term, diversified financing to Member States.\\nFinally, with its strong international commitment on climate issues, Europe must play its full role in initiatives to tackle the risks linked to climate change. The Banque de France was one of the founders of the NGFS or Network for the Greening of the Financial System, and provides secretariat services for the platform which now has 42 members and 8 observers, representing 5 continents. The NGFS aims to share best practices and make recommendations to central banks and supervisors on how to better integrate climate-related risks into their financial stability monitoring and microprudential supervision. Within the framework of the NGFS, the ACPR and Banque de France have begun looking at ways to conduct climate-related stress-tests. In parallel, and in line with the energy transition law, the ACPR has published two reports on the climate risks facing the French banking and insurance industries, and has set up a Climate and Sustainable Finance Commission tasked with monitoring financial institutions' commitments and publishing its findings in an annual report prepared jointly with the AMF.\\n****\\nMy conclusion, therefore, is that we should not just assume that the significant strengthening of the financial system over the past decade is enough. \\nNow more than ever, it is vital that we remain vigilant, to face up to the risks threatening to undermine our financial stability. This means rigorous supervision, and the adoption of a multilateral and coordinated approach in order to implement and complete the reforms to our financial regulation. Safeguarding financial stability, to make the financial system more secure over the long term, is a global challenge and one that requires a global response. "

        "title": "Cleviston Haynes: Strategic human resource management in the age of technology",
        "content": "Good morning.\\nOn behalf of the management and staff of the Central Bank of Barbados, I welcome you to Barbados, and to the XXII Annual Conference of Human Resources Managers of Central Banks in the Caribbean Region, which is being held under the theme, \"HR 4.0: A Perfect Vision - 2020 and Beyond.\"\\nYour theme is forward looking, encapsulating the technological thrust that envelops the operations of the modern-day financial services industry. This is truly appropriate because we live in an era of technological disruption, what many are calling the 4th Industrial Revolution. Concepts that in our youth were unthought of, or at best relegated to the realm of science fiction, now not only exist, but are also commonplace. Terms such as artificial intelligence, Big Data, and blockchain are now a part of our vernacular.\\nWe in the central banking community cannot ignore the emergence of these new technologies. Central banks in the region, including the Central Bank of Barbados, are adapting to the changed environment by examining our processes for the delivery of our services and assessing the adequacy of our resources to cope with the transformation that new technology can engender.\\nThose of you who are somewhat cynical will point out that we are no strangers to technological advances. We've had to deal with changes in technology for decades and we have adapted. I recall that when I first joined the Central Bank of Barbados, we used large charts that had to be updated manually by staff adding pieces of tape to update the monthly changes. It was a painstaking exercise, assigned to an officer blessed with patience and the skill of attention to detail. Now, I can sit at my desk and have Excel create a chart for me in a matter of seconds.\\nDevelopments such as this contribute to the digital transformation that we face across our economies. The pace at which technology is evolving is much faster than what we have seen before, but we cannot treat this digital transformation as if it is simply the latest buzzword.\\nIf we limit ourselves to thinking of digital transformation as simply adopting the latest technology, to digitising or automating processes, we ignore a central tenet of the transformation, i.e. rethinking the way we do things. It entails changes at a fundamental, foundational level, which means that it requires organisations to evolve.\\nThree examples of how technology is transforming how we do business come to mind immediately. The first is payment systems. In recent years, we've seen the emergence of mobile wallets and crypto assets, offered in many cases by entities that fall outside the rubric of traditional prudential regulation. These developments can influence how the financial sector landscape evolves. We must determine if and how to regulate them, and we must develop the capacity to do so. In Barbados, we envisage that new payments system regulation will seek to address this gap in our regulatory framework.\\nThe second is data. More than ever, both the public and private sector rely on accurate, timely, and specific data for analysis and forecasting, and they look to central banks to provide much of that data. We need to ensure we are able to offer the breadth and depth of statistics they require. In this regard, we recently relaunched our online statistics to make access easier for users.\\nThe third is communication. When the Central Bank of Barbados was established 47 years ago, we undertook the task of educating and sensitizing the public on economic matters, using, inter alia, quarterly press conferences and physical documents for our Economic Review and Annual Reports. Now, our audiences are more fragmented than ever, and consume information in different ways. We have to retool our communications to meet their needs. Most of what we produce is now available online, our press conferences are streamed, and our information is disseminated on social media platforms.\\nHR's Role in Digital Transformation\\nAll three examples demonstrate how technology is altering how we function as a central bank. But the transformation that we are witnessing is not about technology only. If it was, it would fall exclusively under the ambit of our IT departments. But at its core, this transformation is really about people.  This is why HR is critical to its success.\\nYou will have to guide your organisation and its employees through this dramatic change.  This is always a difficult feat, but one compounded by the potential anxiety about the new technologies that will form part of this shift. For while in our private lives we readily embrace technology and the conveniences it facilitates - smartphones, Alexa, the myriad social media platforms, and if we travel, Uber and Airbnb - professionally, we are wary of it, perhaps feeling, as Karl Marx did that \"machinery does not just act as a superior competitor to the worker, always on the point of making him superfluous.\"\\nSuch fears can lead to resistance or, in extreme cases, obstruction, to your efforts. Merely offering statistics that show that adopting new technology can lead to increased job creation and higher productivity will not be sufficient to prevent this.\\nHR managers and their teams need to counsel staff about the impending changes, offer a vision of what the transformed organisation will look like, and then shepherd them through the process. This means that you, too, must embrace the idea and all that it encompasses. Indeed, for you to be truly effective, you must also demonstrate your own ability to adapt your systems.\\nOne aspect of this is reskilling. While greater utilisation of technology might not lead to a significant reduction in an organisation's staff complement, it will inevitably lead to a shift in where and how staff members are deployed.\\nAn employee who previously performed a job that can now be made more efficient through automation, could find himself transferred within the organisations to perform a new function.  For many employees, especially those who have spent their entire tenure in one department, and potentially in the same post, this can be a tremendous shock. As HR professionals, you will be tasked with making that transition smoother, including by identifying the training they will need.\\nEven when employees maintain their current position, they will need to broaden the scope of their abilities. Consider our colleagues in our Bank Supervision departments: how many of them even 10 years ago would have contemplated the regulatory challenges posed by FinTech or by new entrants from outside the traditional financial sector into the market? How many would have known how to even approach regulating it?\\nThe education and training employees get before entering the workforce is now just the beginning. They will need to commit to lifelong learning, to continually upgrading their expertise. Indeed, Deloitte estimates that the time it takes for the skills you currently have to become obsolete is a mere two and a half to five years.\\nMoving Beyond \"That's the Way We've Always Done It\"\\nFor us as central banks to effectively fulfil our mandate, we must be able to identify the gaps in employees' competencies and support them as they work to fill them. Be mindful, however, that as we look to embrace this transformation, we will be asking employees to change not only their skillsets, but also their mind-sets.\\nWhile the focus is often on the word \"digital\", the truly challenging part, budgets notwithstanding, is the \"transformation\". We can purchase and deploy the latest technology, but if we simply automate existing processes, we will accomplish nothing.\\nI am sure that many of us are guilty of typing a letter, printing it so we can sign it, then scanning and emailing it.  How many steps could we save simply by using an electronic signature?\\nWhat I just described might seem like a harmless quirk, but let me give you another example.\\nAbout 15 years ago, our Bank purchased a banknote processing machine that could count and authenticate hundreds of banknotes per minute, separate the clean notes from mutilated ones and package or destroy them accordingly. Previously, the process was done manually, with our Currency staff hand-counting the banknotes, but this machine automated the process and produced reports that our internal audit team vetted and approved.\\nHaving that machine should have drastically improved both efficiency and productivity, but initially, it did not. Why? Because one member of staff was not comfortable signing the reports until she had verified, by hand-counting, that the stacks of clean notes were the same number the machine had recorded. That was clearly an example of parallel testing!\\nThat might sound like an extreme case, but the two examples reveal the same thing: we, often to our detriment, hold on to outmoded thinking because \"that's the way we've always done it.\" This means that our employees will need to be coached into moving away from traditional modes of thinking as more efficient methods become available.\\nBoth examples I cited were focused on processes, but there is another area where changing mind-sets is critical, and more challenging. Culture.\\nHere's a quote from Roland Berger's report, \"Central Banking HR of the Future: Driving Strategic Change,\" that describes central banks.\\n\"Central banks are often traditional companies with a rather hierarchical, historically grown organisational structure. They are often divided into \"suborganisations\" or divisions, each performing a specific function. Targets are then defined on the level of the separate departments - often without considering the organisation as a whole.\"\\nI think we can agree that much of this sounds familiar.\\nThe Central Bank of the Future\\nThe report details the changes that are essential for central banks to survive and thrive in the modern era. Much of it reiterates what the literature has been telling us. We need to re-engineer our organisations, so that decisions are made and actioned more quickly, and so that innovative ideas are not lost as they make their way up the chain of command. We need to focus on collaboration, so that we can draw on expertise from wherever it is available, and so that projects are approached from the perspective of what is best for the organisation and not just the department or unit. Building alliances through cross departmental project teams is an effective tool for increased productivity and efficiency.   I recently shared with my staff some of our key achievements for the year, and in almost each case the result was based on cross-departmental collaboration. We need to become transparent so staff have a clear sense of our direction. And we need to be more flexible, so that we can keep apace with a dynamic world.   \\nSuch a radical shift will not come easy for those who are comfortable with how the organisations has functioned traditionally, so HR will need to carefully manage the change process so that change is accepted, embraced and implemented by all within the organisations. It is necessary, for, as the report notes, \"the central bank of the future is designed for speed, agility and adaptability.\"\\nAll that I have mentioned thus far is only part of HR's role in this era of transformation. Even as central banks work to create a conducive culture and to equip employees with the skills to make it successful, HR must also focus on the future. That means attracting talent that fits the new culture and has the right skillset.\\nCentral banks will need to re-evaluate the nature and scope of the tasks our staff will be asked to undertake, and then as we recruit new employees, we will need to cast our nets to find people who have not just the right qualifications, but also the right competencies.\\nThe World Economic Forum identifies creativity as one of the top three competencies workers will need in 2020.  We will need to determine how heavily to weigh this and other softer skills the forum identifies - collaboration, judgment and decision-making, cognitive flexibility - against the credentials we have traditionally sought.  Then we need to find a way to evaluate these attributes in applicants.\\nFinding the right mix in prospective employees may require us to work with educational institutions to make sure that curricula reflect our current and future needs.\\nBeyond this, attracting the right employees will necessitate changing what we have to offer potential employees to make working at a central bank an attractive proposition. Studies are showing us that younger workers are not motivated by the prospect of long-term job security and want more out of a job than a pay cheque alone.  We will need to figure out what we can offer that will appeal to the calibre of worker we want.\\nThis will mean re-examining our job descriptions, work programmes, appraisal systems, and rewards packages. And even then, we must accept that we are unlikely to find workers who will stay with the organisation for 20, 30, or even 40 years, and plan accordingly.\\nFinally, central banks may also look beyond formal hiring and make it a practice to seek outside expertise, who can offer a different perspective. Think of a man who wears the same cologne every day. While the people around him can smell it, he eventually becomes immune to the scent and so uses more. Developing a cadre of subject matter experts in various areas to whom we can turn for clear-eyed critique of our initiatives and actions can help reveal our blind spots and prevent us from becoming that man. Our role is too important to the economic stability of our countries for us to fall short because of tunnel vision.\\nThe world is changing, rapidly and constantly. And we, central banks, are not immune. We must meet the challenge head on, however far outside of our comfort zone it takes us.\\nYou, as HR professionals, will be charged with doing much of the heavy lifting. But you must prepare yourself for the task. By theming this year's conference as you have, it is clear that you recognise this and are committed to arming yourselves to meet the challenge. You are, as I have stressed throughout my remarks, updating, upgrading, and honing your skills to meet the new demands of the world of work. Your theme suggests that you recognize the time for action is now.  I commend you for leading by example, and wish you an enjoyable and educational two days.\\nI thank you."

        "title": "Benjamin E Diokno: The Philippine economy - moving the financial services industry forward through inclusive technology, green initiatives",
        "content": "Officials from The Asian Banker, fellow speakers, representatives from the banking and finance industry, members of the business community, friends from the media, ladies and gentlemen, good morning.\\nI would like to thank The Asian Banker for inviting me today. I am delighted to be here not only because this is a venue to address key stakeholders of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) but also because the theme \"Embarking on Sustainable Innovation in the Digital Economy\" is very close to the heart of the BSP as we aim to bring Central Banking closer to the people.\\nBut before I go into our efforts toward \"sustainable innovation,\" allow me to first give a brief overview of the Philippines' macroeconomic environment, under which our financial services industry is operating in.\\nAs recognized by relevant observers here and abroad, the Philippines is among the fastest growing and most resilient economies in the world today. The Philippines is in a very 'nice' place right now. \\nFirst, economic growth is robust, hitting 6.2 percent last year and expected by the government to remain in the 6-percent territory this year before accelerating further over the next three years.\\nSecond, inflation is manageable, settling at 0.9 percent in September-the lowest in over three years. It is projected to remain well within the BSP's official target range of 2 to 4 percent up to 2021.\\nThird, external payments position is comfortable, serving as a solid buffer for the economy against external headwinds.\\nThe gross international reserves (GIR) as of September 2019 stood at $86.2 billion, which is equivalent to 7.5 months of imports and payments for services and primary income.\\nFourth, fiscal position is healthy, supporting the government's ambitious infrastructure development agenda and rising investments in human capital development.\\nThe budget deficit is programmed to stay at a comfortable 3.2 percent of GDP up to 2022.\\nGovernment debt, which stood at 43.7 percent of GDP as of end-June 2019, is seen to continue its downward trend as growth of the economy outpaces the increase in the debt stock.  \\nFifth, the banking sector is sound and stable, helping fuel growth of the economy through credit and other financial services.\\nCapitalization is more than sufficient, with the capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of universal and commercial banks staying at 15.9 percent in June 2019. This is higher than the BSP's minimum regulatory requirement of 10 percent and the internationally prescribed floor of 8 percent.\\nExposure to bad debts is minimal, with the non-performing loans (NPL) ratio staying at a mere 1.7 percent in August 2019. Total assets of the banking sector continue to grow, rising by 9.0 percent to \\u20b117.4 trillion year-on-year as of end-August 2019.\\nTopping all these is a demographic advantage, with the median age of the population at 24 years old.\\nIn an ageing world, the Philippines' young, educated, and vibrant workforce is helping propel robust, sustainable, and more inclusive economic growth for the country.\\nAmid this favorable backdrop, the BSP has served as a pillar of strength for the economy over the years by fulfilling its mandate of price and financial stability. \\nMoving forward, the BSP is committed to playing an even more active role in maintaining economic stability and in helping achieve the economy's long-term development goals, among which is to reach high-income status by 2040.\\nWe will do so by maximizing the provisions of our newly amended Charter, which enhances the BSP's ability to manage liquidity and supervise the financial sector together with other financial regulators, as well as of the recently signed National Payment Systems Act, which formally recognizes the BSP as supervisor of the country's payments and settlements system.  \\nNow, allow me to focus on \"sustainable innovation\" in the country's financial services sector and the BSP's role in enabling it.\\nWhen I say the BSP is committed to playing a more active role in helping achieve the economy's development goals, what I mean is we are doing tasks outside the traditional central banking function of maintaining price and financial stability.\\nWe want to contribute more to poverty reduction. This will make the BSP more relevant and closer to the Filipino people-something I consider to be my personal mission.\\nWe are doing this through our financial inclusion agenda and ensuring greater access to financial products and services.\\nWhat better way can we accelerate financial inclusion than by promoting a more extensive use of financial technologies or fintech.\\nWith the high penetration rate of mobile phones in the country, where even low-income earners own cell phones-the ability of fintech to accelerate financial inclusion is well recognized.\\nWhile we are leveraging on fintech, a lot of work still needs to be done before the Philippines becomes a truly financially inclusive economy. Many Filipinos still do not own bank accounts, and so are unable to access loans and other financial services from formal channels. \\nNevertheless, we are working our way there.\\nFirst, internet and mobile phone banking. Banks that offer internet and mobile phone banking have increased over the years.\\nThis has allowed more people to do online transactions, not only to pay bills and purchase merchandise goods, but also to avail themselves of savings, investments, and insurance products.\\nAs of end-2018, there were 48 banks that have already made their financial services accessible through the internet, and 26 banks that have made their services accessible through mobile phones. \\nSecond, interoperable payment systems. In the past, transferring funds from an account in one bank to another account in a different bank required physical movement of cash.\\nNow, following the launch of interoperable payments systems, funds can be transferred electronically through InstaPay, for low-value and real-time fund transfers, and PESONet, for bigger-value fund transfers confirmed within the same banking day.\\nAs of end-July 2019, there were 43 financial institutions participating in InstaPay and 51 participating in PESONet, with more to come.\\nThird, the Philippine ID system. Following the signing into law of the Philippine Identification System Act (PhilSys) in August last year, the country will soon have a national identification system.\\nThe objective is for all Filipinos to be properly identified using a unified system that gathers basic identification and biometrics information.\\nThe BSP has assumed the task of printing the IDs. We are doing this because we don't want We expect the Philippine ID system to significantly hasten financial inclusion, as this addresses the problem of lack of formal IDs-which are required to open a bank account.\\nFourth, non-bank electronic money issuers. A recent phenomenon that is significantly boosting financial inclusion in the country is the emergence of non-bank e-money issuers.\\nThese are entities other than banks that also allow people to create electronic accounts in their platforms where people can store value in these electronic accounts, and make payments or do a remittance.\\nAs of 27 August 2019, there were 14 non-bank e-money issuers supervised by the BSP.\\nFifth, quick response codes or QR codes. The use of QR codes for payments has started to gain traction. In fact, last month, I was able to buy McDonalds through QR Payment option by PayMaya.\\nWe hope to see more of this in the future; we hope that even market vendors, cab drivers, and sari-sari store owners will be able to use QR codes as a means to accept payments. To help move this along, the BSP is working with industry players to put in place a National QR Code Standard that will enable interoperability of QR Code-based payment facilities.\\nOther ongoing initiatives to advance e-payments are digitalization of government collections and disbursement, and the assessment and monitoring of the country's transition to a more cash-light economy with National Payments Diagnostics.\\nWith these updates, we expect to have at least 20 percent of all financial transactions in the country done electronically by 2020.\\nNevertheless, the BSP is mindful that with innovations come risks. As such, we are keen to make sure the regulatory environment is dynamic and attuned to industry developments. As our regulated entities adopt innovations to enhance delivery of their services to customers, the BSP is likewise embracing technology to improve consumer protection.\\nFor instance, the BSP is working to provide an alternative channel for the public to elevate banking-related complaints through an automated Chatbot system, which is targeted to go live by mid-2020.\\nThe Chatbot, using artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP), will be able to adequately and efficiently handle consumer concerns coursed through channels including SMS and social media.\\nIn addition, the BSP has developed a prototype that allows machine-to-machine link between the BSP's system and those of its supervised entities for streamlined transmission, processing, warehousing, and analysis of banks' prudential reports. Targeted to go live by the latter part of 2020, this innovation will significantly improve timeliness, ease, and integrity of data submission.\\nBecause of these initiatives, I am proud to report that BSP won the \"Artificial Intelligence Initiative\" award and the \"Data Management Initiative\" award by Central Banking Publications during its Fintech and Regtech Global Awards held in Singapore last month.\\nIn any case, the BSP observes the following principles in its regulatory approach to innovations in the financial services sector: (i) risk-based supervision, (ii) active stakeholder engagement; and (iii) consumer protection.\\n\"Risk-based\" means BSP-regulated entities are enjoined to put up the necessary risk management systems and sufficient capital to cover their respective levels of exposure to technological risks.\\n\"Active stakeholder engagement\" means the BSP is actively engaging supervised entities to constantly get updates from them on innovation trends that the regulatory environment should capture.\\n\"Consumer protection\" means financial institutions offering fintech-enabled services are required to have the necessary safeguards to ensure the protection of financial consumers against IT-related fraud and data compromise. \\nI've talked a lot about \"innovations\" but let me also go into the sustainable aspect in all these.\\nNeedless to say that there is an urgent need for the entire world to more vigorously address climate change. I'm sure that by now, we are all familiar with a young environmentalist-a 16-year-old girl from Sweden named Greta Thunberg who addressed the United Nations and challenged policymakers worldwide to squarely address the issue. \\nWhat does this have to do with us in the Philippines' financial services industry? Well, the BSP recognizes the crucial role it plays in driving investments that promote climate-resilient, green, and sustainable growth.\\nIn fact, the BSP has a two-pronged approach to promoting sustainable finance: 1) capacity building and awareness campaigns, and 2) enabling regulations.\\nIn capacity building, the BSP takes part in several domestic and international fora on sustainability. One of which is the ASEAN Task Force on the Roles of Central Banks in Addressing Climate and Environment-Related Risks. The task force will conduct a study on the roles of central banks in addressing climate and environment-related risk to monetary, financial, and broader macroeconomic stability.\\nThe BSP is also a member of the International Finance Corporation (IFC)-supported Sustainable Banking Network. The BSP, together with IFC, conducted a scoping research to better understand how to best embed environmental and social risk management as well as sustainable finance principles in the business decisions of financial institutions.\\nThe BSP is also coordinating with the British Embassy in Manila on the possible capacity building initiatives under the Low Carbon Energy Programme (LCEP) of the UK Prosperity Fund. LCEP can provide support in terms of policy, capacity building, technical assistance and market development.\\nIn enabling regulations, the BSP has come up with a proposed policy framework for sustainable finance, and we are currently in the process of consolidating and evaluating comments from industry players.\\nSome of the highlights of the proposed regulatory framework are as follows:\\n(1) Banks are expected to integrate environmental and social governance (ESG), and sustainability principles in their strategic direction, as well as in their corporate governance and risk management frameworks.\\n(2) Banks shall conduct scenario analysis and stress testing of its business exposures to assess their vulnerabilities over several ESG scenarios. Results shall be taken into account in their capital planning and business strategies.\\n(3) Banks will be required to disclose their sustainability agenda in their annual reports, including risk appetites in the ESG field.\\nThe policy framework will be embodied in a circular that we will issue soon-the first of a series of circulars on sustainable finance.\\nIn a related development, the BSP, together with the Department of Finance (DOF), co-chairs a newly formed inter-agency task force that is mandated to facilitate green finance initiatives. Members include the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), Bureau of the Treasury (BTR), Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA), Department of Energy (DOE), and Climate Change Commission (CCC).\\nThe interagency committee is working on a draft executive order - for the signature of the President- that will spell out deliverables and targets in relation to green finance initiatives of the country.\\nMeantime, some banks are already embarking on green finance while regulations on these are under way. In particular, a number of banks have put up Sustainable Energy Finance Desks, which serve as a point of contact in evaluating and monitoring sustainable energy projects. These encourage enterprises to engage in renewable energy projects.\\nIn addition, some banks recently issued green bonds and sustainability bonds. Also, government-owned Land Bank has implemented the Climate SMART (Synergistic, Mitigation, Adaptation, Resiliency, and Transformation) Financing Program, which offers various lending facilities related to environment and sustainable financing.\\nWhile all these developments in sustainable financing are encouraging, the world is at the beginning of mass extinction due to climate change, and so much more needs to be done.\\nAnd so I challenge everyone in the financial services industry, including us regulators, to do more.\\nWe have to be even more proactive in green financing, especially so that the Philippines is cited as among the highly vulnerable countries to the effects of climate change.\\nIn closing, the financial services sector is at an interesting time. Technological innovations in the delivery of financial services are contributing significantly to the Philippine economy's transformation. But at the same time, with climate related risks threatening not only economic growth but life itself, industry members are also facing a great challenge.\\nRest assured that we at the BSP will be working together with our supervised entities in stepping up efforts toward sustainable innovations in the financial services industry. We hope that you can also help us in stepping up and speeding up our sustainable innovations-not just for the Filipino people but with the future of our world in mind.\\nThank you very much and mabuhay!"

        "content": "Section 1: Introduction\\n\"Pay gaps\" measure the difference in pay between people with different demographic characteristics doing identical jobs. They are considered to be a good approximation of inequality in workplace rewards (EHRC (2018)). Under the Equality Act 2010, it is against the law to discriminate on the basis of protected personal characteristics. When it comes to pay, this means people should earn the same wage for the same work, irrespective of their gender, race, religion, disability, or other protected characteristics. In other words, no \"pay gap\" should exist across any of these characteristics.\\nSince 2017, it has been compulsory for companies in Great Britain with over 250 employees to report gender pay gaps each financial year. Data for 2018 published earlier this year shows a gender pay gap of around 10% across reporting UK organisations. The UK government has also begun a consultation on requiring companies to publish ethnicity pay gaps on an annual basis. While 63% of employers monitor ethnicity pay gaps, only 31% of employers currently publish them. The Bank of England has published data on its gender pay gap since 2017 and on its ethnicity pay gap since 2018."

        "content": "Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. It is always a pleasure to engage with key stakeholders of the finance industry as it gives us the opportunity to advance the BSP's advocacies.\\nIn fact, today's theme of \"Collaborative Approach to Regulating Fintech\" is exactly how we envision the landscape of overseeing the increasingly disruptive, yet, vibrant narrative of Fintech developments.\\nOver the past couple of years, innovative solutions through technological advancements have transformed the delivery of financial services by offering alternative and far convenient ways of executing financial transactions.\\nIt has empowered the unbanked and underbanked to participate in the economy through easier access to financial services.\\nIndeed, FinTech players are moving ahead of the curve by developing solutions that aim to expand delivery channels and trim unnecessary processes towards providing greater efficiency and convenience for customers.\\nWe, at the BSP, emphasize our support for such endeavors. We view innovators as enablers of financial services that help us boost our financial inclusion agenda.\\nThe number of FinTech players in the Philippines have gradually been growing in the past three years with most, or around 75% of the total providing payments, alternative financing, and remittance services.\\n2018, in particular, has been a key period for blockchain and virtual currencie.\\nThere has been an increasing amount of BSP Supervised Financial Institutions that have leveraged on FinTech to support their business strategies and manage day-to-day business processes.\\nThis prompted us to craft appropriate regulations to safeguard public interest while fully recognizing that these technological innovations can contribute to a more inclusive and safe financial ecosystem.\\nOur approach to regulating FinTechs is shaped by three principles,\\n(a)    first, we ensure that regulation is risk-based, proportionate and fair,\\n(b)    second, we maintain active multi-stakeholder collaboration,\\n(c)    and lastly, we ensure that innovations must work for the benefit of consumers, especially the most vulnerable ones.\\nGuided by these principles, came the rise of our three-lane FinTech roadmap that is crafted to nurture a regulatory environment that allows innovations to flourish, yet still mindful that risks must be effectively managed and that the financial system remains safe and sound.\\nThe first lane refers to Collaborative Engagements. The continuing collaboration with industry players and other financial regulators represents a \"whole-of-government approach\", ensuring policy consistency and minimizing, if not fully preventing, regulatory arbitrage.\\nWith this in mind, the BSP openly engages with fintech players and innovators through a flexible \"test and learn\" environment or the \"regulatory sandbox\" that enables us to fully understand emerging business models while assessing attendant risks.\\nI will not dwell on specifics but generally, the framework consists of five important steps commencing from the enabling stance adopted by the BSP during initial engagement with the applicant, guided and clear rules for implementation, until continuing monitoring of matured services.\\nWith such an approach, we are able to timely employ risk-mitigating actions and craft appropriate policies revolving around consumers' welfare and protection and secure financial system.\\nThe middle lane refers to our Capacity Building initiatives.\\nIn 2018, we established a dedicated Financial Technology Subsector (FTSS) to institutionalize the operational and cyber-resilience of the financial system.\\nUnder FTSS is the Technology Risk and Innovation Supervision Department (TRISD), which is primarily responsible for conducting onsite and offsite IT supervision of regulated entities, as well as maintaining a comprehensive and flexible regulatory framework relating to IT supervision. TRISD is also in charge of cybersecurity surveillance and promoting digital or FinTech innovation through BSP's regulatory sandbox.\\nEqually important is the Payment Systems Oversight Department (PSOD) which is mainly responsible for the payments oversight, licensing and policy development for a safe, efficient and reliable national payment system. It espouses on the use of technology as enabler of innovation in payment systems and is the lead in enforcing a holistic payment oversight framework, including the National Retail Payment System.\\nWe are also in the midst of implementing solutions that make use of artificial intelligence and machine learning for regulatory and supervisory processes. These RegTech and SupTech tools aim to augment areas of risk management, regulatory reporting, consumer complaint oversight and regulatory compliance automation.\\nThis includes a chatbot, an automated complaint-handling system which uses predictive analytics to address consumer concerns and an API that automates the collection, processing, and analysis of data from supervised institutions. Supervised entities that cannot immediately migrate to the API-based reporting can use the FI portal in submission of their reports.\\nAll of these are aimed at streamlining our manual-intensive processes, thereby enhancing the timeliness and quality of our risk-based decision-making and financial system supervision.\\nThe third and final lane refers to Commensurate Regulations.\\nConsistent with the supervisory objectives of the BSP, we apply the same approach to FinTech by considering the soundness of the individual institution, the landscape of the financial system, and the risk peculiarities in individual operations.\\nThis ensures that we promote a level playing field for the new entrants and that we will not hamper the innovation with unwarranted and excessive compliance requirements.\\nSome of our recent key issuances include:\\n(a) Circular No. 1022 which updated rules for validating client identity by accepting the PhilSys ID and allowing the use of technology-aided know-your-customer processes to capture and record personal customer data as well as conduct virtualized face-to-face contact or interview.\\n(b) Circular No. 1033 on the streamlined the process of securing licenses to engage in Electronic Payments and Financial Services, doing away with the tedious approval process of requiring conditional and final approval.\\n(c) Circular No. 1039 on the simplified the documentary or registration requirements for Money Service Businesses and pawnshops operators.\\nFinally, in accordance with the BSP's authority under Republic Act No. 11127 or the National Payment Systems Act to oversee payment systems in the Philippines, the BSP issued Circular 1049 to provide for a streamlined registration that aims to facilitate and encourage compliance of all concerned entities, particularly those previously unregulated non-financial institutions unfamiliar with regulatory compliance.\\nSoon, a new Manual of Regulations for Payment Systems (MORPS) will be prepared to consolidate all relevant BSP issuances. The manual will be a product of extensive consultations among private and public stakeholders in the payments industry. It will also be part of the phased-in implementation of the NPSA that prioritizes the creation of a baseline inventory of all OPS.\\nWe also have the National Retail Payment System (NRPS) which leverages on the principles of interoperability, inclusiveness and \"coopetition\".\\nThe NRPS, and the payment ecosystem that is envisioned to arise from it, is positioned to be a platform for FinTech innovations where industry players can utilize FinTech solutions and provide services within an organized, commercially-viable and efficient retail payment system.\\nNotwithstanding all of these developments, we recognize that the FinTech narrative goes beyond just the BSP.  In fact, more pioneering solutions are cutting across regimes of different regulators of the financial sector.\\nThis is why in the 3rd quarter of last year, the Financial Sector Forum, composed of four financial regulators in the country, namely the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Insurance Commission (IC), the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC) and the BSP, formed a FinTech Committee aimed at harmonizing regulatory responses to FinTech innovation in the financial sector.\\nAmong the priority agenda that the FSF-Fintech Committee undertook was identifying the numerous Fintech use cases and the scope of authorities of each regulators. Through clear understanding and increased collaboration, financial regulators can quickly anticipate changes, assess technological trends across different sectors, and optimize the potential of digital innovations to provide more convenient, and efficient financial services.\\nThe cross-cutting nature of FinTech developments has also magnified the importance of shifting to activity-based regulations. Likewise, I am pleased to share that the FSF-Fintech Committee is in the initial stages of crafting a Cooperative Oversight Framework which will institutionalize our collaboration and clarify regulations to all supervised and would be supervised entities.\\nBut again ladies and gentlemen, we are just one side of this financial equation and we need your support in striking the balance of ensuring that regulatory and supervisory frameworks are in tune with emerging trends and developments.\\nWe hope that you can actively help us shape this narrative into something that is desirable, safe, sustainable, inclusive and rewarding for all stakeholders, most especially the Filipino people.\\nAs we move forward in this collaboration, I hope that we all keep the benefit of the Filipino people in mind.\\nThank you for the opportunity and I am looking forward to engaging conversations with all of you.\\nNeedless to say that the BSP, as your partner in promoting financial innovation and inclusion, will remain dedicated and committed in supporting beneficial FinTech innovations through an enabling policy and regulatory environment.\\nThank you and I wish everyone a fruitful conference."

        "title": "Yannis Stournaras: Greece in Europe - reasons for optimism",
        "content": "Ladies and gentlemen,\\nIt is a great honour for me to be invited to deliver the Annual Stavros Niarchos Foundation Lecture. The Hellenic Studies Program at the Yale Macmillan Center does an excellent job in studying and promoting contemporary Greek culture and history. In my talk today, I will first present the lessons to be drawn from the Greek crisis. I will then discuss the progress made in recent years and the outlook for the Greek economy, and highlight the crisis legacies and the challenges that lie ahead, both for Greece and the euro area. Finally, I will put forward policy proposals for addressing these challenges.\\n1.         Overview and lessons from the Greek crisis\\nFrom 2000 to 2007, Greece experienced benign macroeconomic conditions characterised by high rates of GDP growth (well above the euro area average), relatively stable consumer price inflation and a gradually decreasing unemployment rate. The expansion was driven by rapid credit growth and low borrowing costs following financial liberalisation and Greece's EMU entry in 2001.\\nThe Maastricht criteria for joining EMU were based solely on nominal convergence, and therefore failed to incentivise the structural reforms in the product and labour markets and in the functioning of the public sector needed to enhance real convergence, raise potential growth and safeguard the sustainability of public finances. On the contrary, employer and employee interest groups opposed reforms that would have increased competitiveness. Although Greece's GDP per capita increased during the boom period, approaching the EU average, the institutional gap relative to the euro area did not narrow. Thus, Greece continued to lag significantly behind its euro area partners in various indicators of governance and structural competitiveness.\\nThe sharp deterioration of the fiscal and macroeconomic environment in 2008 and 2009, and the subsequent downgrades of sovereign debt and rising sovereign spreads, cut off the Greek sovereign and banks from international capital and money markets. Substantial deposit withdrawals and extremely tight liquidity conditions put strain on the banking sector. An EU-IMF financed economic adjustment programme was initiated in 2010, aiming to correct the imbalances.\\nThe crisis has taken a heavy toll on output, incomes and wealth. Between 2008 and 2016, Greece lost over one fourth of its GDP at constant prices, and the unemployment rate rose by nearly 16 percentage points. Furthermore, GDP per capita at purchasing power parity declined to 67.4% of the EU average in 2018, down from 93.3% in 2008. To this, one must add the large increase of non-performing loans (NPL) ratio to about 50%, the large brain drain and massive underinvestment, with their immeasurable economic and social consequences.\\nThe slide of the GDP growth rate into negative territory raised the debt-to-GDP ratio to unsustainable levels despite the fiscal consolidation, and caused debt-servicing problems for households and businesses. This was the main, but not the exclusive, reason why NPLs rose dramatically, weakening banks' asset quality, thus making it difficult for banks to finance the real economy. It took no less than eight years, three economic adjustment programmes, major debt restructuring and three rounds of bank recapitalisation to resolve the Greek crisis.\\nThe length and depth of the Greek crisis can be explained by seven factors:\\n\\xb7         First, the size and speed of fiscal consolidation were unprecedented. This primarily had to do with the fact that the initial fiscal and external imbalances were much higher in Greece than in other Member States under financial stress. In addition, emphasis has, on average, been placed, over the three adjustment programmes, more on tax hikes rather than expenditure cuts, growth-enhancing reforms and privatisations.\\n\\xb7           Second, the fiscal multipliers turned out to be higher than initially anticipated, and the economy was soon caught in a vicious circle of austerity and recession.\\n\\xb7         Third, the sequencing of structural reforms led to real wages declining more than initially expected, exacerbating the recession. In other words, the reform effort focused much more on the labour market than on the goods and services markets. Hence, nominal wages declined faster and more strongly than prices. Households experienced a massive drop in purchasing power, which, in turn, constrained personal consumption and deepened the recession.\\n\\xb7           Fourth, the non-performing loans (NPL) problem proved very difficult to manage. Mainly the result of economic contraction, it was further exacerbated by legislative changes such as the blanket moratorium on primary residence auctions and the abuse of foreclosure protection, as well as several other legal and judicial impediments. With the benefit of hindsight, it could be said that a more dynamic response during the first years of the crisis, implementing the necessary legislative changes much earlier and introducing a systemic solution via a centralised Asset Management Company for NPLs as other Member States had done, could have reduced the problem we face today.\\n\\xb7           Fifth, certain reforms fell behind the agreed time schedule on account of a number of factors, including: insufficient ownership of the necessary reforms; populist rhetoric, political rivalry; and the resistance of various vested interests to reform. This had serious consequences: the signing of a third economic adjustment programme, the introduction of capital controls mainly to stem the outflow of bank deposits, another bank recapitalisation round and two years of economic stagnation.\\n\\xb7           Sixth, political deliberations in the euro area also played their part in delaying the recovery of the Greek economy. The Eurogroup decision of November 2012 to grant further debt relief was put off for several years and was only implemented in June 2018. This undermined the growth prospects of the Greek economy and prolonged the crisis. Had this form of debt relief been given at the beginning of the first economic adjustment programme, alongside the implementation of ambitious growth-enhancing structural reforms and an Asset Management Company to deal with NPLs, it would have had a more positive impact on the economy, possibly limiting output and employment losses.\\n\\xb7           Seventh, when the Greek crisis broke out, EMU lacked the tools to prevent or contain the crisis. The Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) failed to control the build-up of public debt in the pre-crisis period. There was insufficient monitoring and control over macroeconomic imbalances, such as the evolution of the current account and private debt. The sovereign-bank \"doom loop\" amplified the financial crisis and the recession. Euro area crisis management and resolution tools were poor or non-existent on account of highly exaggerated concerns about moral hazard, and due to the lack of an appropriate institutional setting. There was no provision for risk-sharing in the initial EMU architecture. It was the ECB's response, especially after mid-2012, which provided the time required for euro area governments to take the actions necessary to safeguard the stability of the financial system and strengthen EMU.\\n2.         Progress since the beginning of the crisis\\nDespite the missteps, occasional backsliding and delays, significant progress has been made since the beginning of the sovereign debt crisis in 2010. The implementation of economic adjustment programmes has eliminated the root causes of the Greek crisis. More specifically:\\n\\xb7         The achieved fiscal adjustment was unprecedented, turning a primary deficit of 10.1% of GDP in 2009 into a primary surplus of 4.3% of GDP in 2018 (according to the enhanced surveillance definition). The primary surplus in 2018 exceeded the programme target for the fourth year in a row.\\n\\xb7         The current account deficit has been reduced by 12 percentage points of GDP since the beginning of the crisis.\\n\\xb7         Labour cost competitiveness has been fully restored, and price competitiveness has recorded substantial gains since 2009.\\n\\xb7         A bold programme of structural reforms was implemented, covering such areas as the pension and healthcare systems, goods and services markets, the business environment, the tax system, the budgetary framework and public sector transparency.\\n\\xb7         The banking system has been restructured. Today only four systemic banks control over 95% of the market, as more than ten other banks were merged or liquidated. The role of the Bank of Greece was pivotal in the restructuring and recapitalisation of the banking system, the enhancement of its corporate governance and the provision of liquidity all over Greece during the crisis. Today, banks' capital adequacy ratios stand at satisfactory levels, and their loan-loss provisions are sufficient to address potential credit risks.\\nA number of important reforms have been implemented, aiming to provide banks with an array of tools for tackling the problem of non-performing loans (NPLs), including a strengthening of the supervisory framework, by setting operational targets for NPL reduction, the creation of a secondary NPL market and the removal of various legal, judicial and administrative barriers to the management of NPLs.\\nThese actions have started to bear fruit, as shown by the continued reduction of the NPL stock in line with the targets set. Non-performing loans amounted to \\u20ac75.4 billion at the end of June 2019, down by \\u20ac31.9 billion from their peak in March 2016. However, the NPL ratio remains high, at 43.6% in June 2019.\\nAs a result of the reforms implemented since the beginning of the crisis and the effort of enterprises to make up for declining domestic demand by exporting to new markets, openness has increased substantially and the economy has started to rebalance towards tradable, export-oriented sectors.\\n\\xb7         The share of total exports in GDP increased from 19.0% in 2009 to 36% in 2018. Exports of goods and services, excluding the shipping sector, have increased in real terms by 60% since their trough in 2009, outperforming euro area exports as a whole.\\n\\xb7         The volume of tradable goods and services in the economy increased cumulatively between 2010 and 2017 by approximately 14% relative to non-tradables in terms of gross value added.\\n3.         The outlook for the Greek economy\\nFollowing the stagnation of 2015-2016, GDP growth returned to positive territory in 2017 (1.5%) and picked up to 1.9% in 2018. Recent real GDP data point to continued expansion in the second quarter of 2019 (1.9% y-o-y). Thanks to the improved economic conditions and to the reforms implemented since 2010, the unemployment rate, though still high, fell to 16.9% in the second quarter of 2019, from 27.8% at the end of 2013. Looking forward, the Bank of Greece expects that economic activity will remain on a positive growth trajectory, expanding by 1.9% in 2019 (that is by 2.3% year-on-year in the second semester of 2019) and above 2% in 2020.\\nThe outlook is subject to downside risks, related both to the external and the domestic environment. The global growth and trade slowdown due to the imminent trade war could affect export growth more markedly, while the disorderly Brexit, geopolitical tensions and the recent increase in oil prices are further significant downside risks. A possible sharp correction in global capital and financial markets could increase the cost and reduce the availability of funding, particularly for the private sector. There are also downside risks on the fiscal front, associated with ongoing court rulings on pension cuts, which could weigh on debt sustainability. In addition, an exacerbation of the refugee crisis could hurt tourism and trade. However, there are also domestic opportunities, relating to a rapid implementation of structural reforms in Greece and the reduction (both direct and indirect) of the primary surplus fiscal targets. The fact that Greece still lags behind its peers and competitors in almost all indices of structural competitiveness, is a huge opportunity for a rapid catch-up which should be exploited.\\n4.         Future challenges\\nDespite the progress made so far, major short- and medium- to long-term challenges and crisis-related legacies remain.\\nA)    Medium- to long-term challenges\\nThe main medium- to long-term challenges are the following:\\n\\xb7         The high public debt (whose sustainability improved sign ificantly in the medium term with the measures adopted by the Eurogroup from 2012 to 2018) creates uncertainty about Greece's ability to service its debt in the long term, raising the cost of borrowing both for the public and the private sector, and hampering growth prospects.\\n\\xb7         Greece's negative current account balance and large negative net international investment position.\\n\\xb7         The high long-term unemployment rate, which generates inequalities threatening social cohesion and increases the risk of human capital erosion. \\n\\xb7         The projected demographic decline (due to population ageing and outward migration), which exerts downward pressure on potential growth and puts at risk the long-term sustainability of the pension system.\\n\\xb7         The slow digital transformation of the economy. Based on the Digital Economy and Society Index of the European Commission, Greece for the year 2019 ranks 26th among the 28 EU countries, which implies a high risk of technological lag and digital illiteracy. \\n\\xb7         The multi-year recession has left an investment gap and risks permanently impairing the productive capacity of the Greek economy through a hysteresis effect. In more detail, gross fixed capital formation (at current prices) fell from 26% of GDP in 2007 to 11.1% of GDP in 2018. The largest proportion of this decline (10.1 out of 14.9 percentage points) is due to shrinking residential investment, which fell from 10.8% of GDP in 2007 to 0.7% of GDP in 2018.\\n\\xb7         Fixed capital investment net of depreciation has been negative since 2011. Specifically, in 2018, net fixed capital investment amounted to roughly -\\u20ac8.8 billion or -4.8% of nominal GDP. Positive net investment is a prerequisite, if the capital stock and thus the potential output of the Greek economy are to increase.\\n\\xb7         Estimates by the Bank of Greece indicate that the net capital stock of the Greek economy (at constant 2010 prices) declined by \\u20ac67.4 billion in the period 2010-2016, to \\u20ac622.2 billion in 2016. In order to raise the net capital stock over the next decade to pre-crisis levels, gross fixed capital formation at constant prices needs to increase by about 10% per year. Excluding residential investment, which accounts for about 50% of the capital stock, gross fixed capital formation at constant prices needs to increase by about 5% per year by 2029. Although a business investment growth rate of 5% per year over the next decade is high, it is deemed achievable for the Greek economy based on historical experience, so long as suitable investment and business-friendly policies are pursued.\\n\\xb7         Investments need to accelerate in order to bridge the investment gap in a timely manner and avoid the so-called hysteresis effect. As recently pointed out by the European Commission, Greece needs additional public and private investment in transport, solid waste and industrial sewage treatment, water supply, infrastructure and energy network connectivity, mainly between island regions and mainland Greece, in information and communication technology (ICT), and in innovation, education and training.\\n\\xb7         Many of the above investments would align Greece's environmental protection standards with those of the rest of the EU, something particularly important given the risks of climate change. Addressing the challenge of climate change calls for coordinated efforts. Incidentally, the Bank of Greece has been playing an active role in this area through its Climate Change Impacts Study Committee (CCISC) and its various publications on the topic. Moreover, the Bank participates in the Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), aiming to enhance the role of the financial system in managing climate and environmental risks, analyse the macro-financial impact of climate change and strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change.\\nB)     Short-term challenges\\nApart from the medium- to long-term challenges, the Greek economy also faces major challenges in the immediate future, which need to be dealt with as a matter of urgency:\\n\\xb7         Greek government bonds have yet to regain investment grade status, despite the substantial decline in their yields after the new government took office and the recent successful issuance of a new 7-year Greek government bond at a yield of 1.9% with significant participation from foreign institutional investors. Recently, Greek 10-year government bond yields fell below 1.4%, and, what is even more important, the corresponding spread fell below 200 basis points. It is estimated that investment grade status could cut further the spread by 60 basis points.\\n\\xb7         The Greek economy continues to face very tight fiscal and monetary conditions compared to all the other Member States of the euro area, which negatively affects its growth prospects and overall competitiveness.\\n-  Primary surpluses in recent years have been very large. The high primary surplus targets and their systematic overachievement in recent years through the curtailment of public investment spending and high taxes have dampened the growth dynamics of the economy, reduced the competitiveness of Greek businesses, created a disincentive to work and invest, and caused tax fatigue, leading to a contraction of the tax base and an exhaustion of taxpaying capacity.\\n-  The monetary policy easing by the ECB has indirectly benefited Greek businesses and households, but not to the extent that it would have, if Greek government bonds had been eligible for the Asset Purchase Programme (APP). The fact that all the other Member States enjoy much more favourable financing conditions for their businesses has an indirect negative effect on Greece's overall competitiveness.\\n-  The high stock of non-performing loans (NPLs) impairs banks' lending capacity and increases lending costs. This is yet another reason, on top of the previous one, why Greek businesses continue to face higher financing costs than their European counterparts, which undermine their competitive position, despite the significant drop in unit labour costs following the wide range of reforms that were implemented in recent years. It is indicative that, according to the most recently available data, the average bank lending rate for businesses in Greece is still slightly below 5%, compared to slightly above 2% in the euro area.\\n\\xb7         Up to now, the business environment had not been considered investment-friendly and in fact discouraged investment. Non-price competitiveness, so-called structural competitiveness, is low compared to Greece's EU partners. This is mainly due to high tax rates, weak public sector efficiency and delays in court proceedings and rulings. Here are some numbers:\\n-  According to the World Economic Forum (October 2018)1 Greece ranked 103rd out of 140 countries in Checks and Balances (which refers to budget transparency, judicial independence, efficiency of legal framework in challenging regulations and freedom of the press), 115th in Public Sector Performance (which refers to the burden of government regulation, efficiency of legal framework in settling disputes, e-Participation index, future orientation of government), 119th in Property Rights Protection (which refers to property rights, intellectual property protection and quality of land administration), and 119th as regards the Strength of Auditing and Reporting Standards.\\n-  According to the World Bank's Doing Business Report for 2019, Greece ranks 132nd out of 190 countries in terms of Enforcing Contracts. Specifically, it takes 1,580 days for a case to be heard by the competent court of first instance and for the ruling to be enforced, compared to 582.4 days in the OECD high-income economies. Resolving insolvency takes 3.5 years, compared to 1.7 years in the OECD high-income economies. Thus, the recovery rate is 33.2% in Greece against 70.5% in the OECD high-income economies.\\n5.         Policy actions to address short- and medium- to long-term challenges\\nThe reformist policy agenda of the new Greek government, elected last July, is viewed positively by the international financial markets, as indicated by the rapid decline in Greek government bond yields, which, as already said,  currently stand at below 1.4%. The government is swiftly implementing its planned investment and growth-friendly policies, which involve lowering business taxes and placing more emphasis on reforms and privatisations, as a means to address short- and long-term challenges and reinforce the credibility of economic policy. Meanwhile, the substantial improvement in budget execution, according to recently published Bank of Greece cash data, between end-June and end-August 2019, indicate that the primary surplus fiscal target for 2019 will be met. This should support the efforts of the Greek government to achieve an upgrade of government bonds to investment grade status by international credit rating agencies. Should this happen, Greek bonds would then be allowed to participate in the ECB's recently-enhanced Asset Purchase Programme (APP), and, therefore, to reap substantial benefits in terms of lower borrowing costs for the Greek economy.\\nTo this end, economic policy should follow a three-pronged approach, aimed at:\\n(a) achieving the agreed fiscal targets;\\n(b) drastically reducing NPLs; and\\n(c) stepping up the pace of structural reforms and privatisations.\\n(a) Achieving the agreed fiscal targets\\nThe fact that the new government immediately announced that it will respect the agreed fiscal targets is a welcome development. At the same time, in line with what the Bank of Greece has repeatedly stressed in recent years, the government is negotiating a reduction (both direct and indirect) of the primary surplus target with the institutions.\\nA lower, more realistic, primary surplus target compared to the current one of 3.5% of GDP through 2022, if combined with more reforms and privatisations, would probably imply lower, rather than higher public debt. This is so because, with a public debt-to-GDP ratio of 180%, a one percentage point-higher growth rate (likely to materialise if the lower primary surplus target is achieved through lower taxes and social contributions, combined with more privatisations and reforms) and/or 100 basis points-lower borrowing costs (already materialised, relative to the European Commission's baseline scenario) are 1.8 times more effective in reducing the debt ratio than an additional GDP percentage point of primary surplus.\\nThe fact that government borrowing costs today are much lower than under the baseline scenario in the European Commission's debt sustainability analysis, provides leeway for easing the fiscal targets without compromising debt sustainability. Moreover, the Stability and Growth Pact allows for fiscal flexibility so long as additional reforms increase potential growth.\\nIn a nutshell, there appear to be sufficient grounds for lowering the primary surplus targets and ample room for a compromise solution. In such a solution, primary surpluses could be lowered in exchange for an acceleration of reforms. The outcome will be a win-win situation for Greece, as well as for its EU partners, given that Greece will be able to return faster to a high growth path that safeguards fiscal sustainability and the repayment of bailout funds. Downside risks related to external factors also justify a reduction of the primary surplus fiscal target.\\n(b) Drastically reducing NPLs\\nPriority must continue to be given to reducing the high stock of non-performing loans (NPLs), which impairs banks' profitability and lending capacity and delays the recovery of investment and economic activity. As I mentioned earlier, the ratio of NPLs to total loans remains very high (43.6% in June 2019). According to the operational targets for NPL reduction, the aim is to bring the NPL ratio down to 35% by end-2019 and to below 20% by end-2021. Overall, despite the progress in this regard, the pace of NPL reduction has not been fast enough to bring the Greek NPL ratio close to the European average of 3.1% as of March 2019.\\nThe activation of a truly systemic solution to the NPL problem, which resembles an Asset Management Company (AMC), would - alongside the banks' own efforts - be key for cleaning up the balance sheets of banks, for bank lending to increase and for investment to recover. After all, similar solutions have been implemented in almost all Member States under financial stress.\\n(c) Stepping up the pace of structural reforms and privatisations\\nForeign direct investment (FDI) is necessary, as domestic savings are insufficient to match the investments needed for high growth rates. If Greece is to attract more FDI, it must speed up privatisations, which mobilise additional private investment, promote private-public partnerships in various sectors and focus on removing major disincentives, such as red tape; the lack of a clear and stable legislative and regulatory framework; an unpredictable tax system; weaknesses in property rights protection; limited access to financing and high borrowing costs, and delays in legal dispute resolution. The lifting of capital controls on September 1st is an important step towards attracting foreign direct investment.\\nIn addition to helping reduce the investment gap, FDI promotes closer trade links with countries and companies with state-of-the-art technologies and facilitates participation in global value chains. This would increase openness and improve both the quantity and quality of Greek exports.\\nGreater emphasis must also be placed on improving public sector efficiency through the modernisation and digitisation of public administration and state-owned enterprises, with a redesigning of procedures and responsibilities, and the evaluation and development of staff capacities and infrastructures.\\nLegal certainty and clarity and a stable legal framework as well as the speedy and reliable resolution of legal disputes would be fundamental to strengthening the rule of law, improving the investment climate and accelerating economic growth.\\nMoreover, international experience has shown that robust economic growth is achieved by countries with good governance and strong, independent institutions.\\nFinally, it is necessary to strengthen the \"knowledge triangle\" (education, research and innovation) through policies and reforms that promote research, technology diffusion, entrepreneurship and foster closer ties between businesses, research centres and universities. Strengthening the knowledge triangle and ICT would lead to the digital transformation of the economy, an increase in the stock of knowledge and productive capital, the development of outward-oriented sectors and, more generally, to a knowledge economy and society.\\n6.         The need to strengthen EMU\\n(a) Progress and remaining challenges\\nGreece belongs to the euro area and is directly affected by its economic and financial conditions. Hence, Greece has a very strong interest in promoting and supporting policies that strengthen the euro area economy. Policy makers around the world have learned their lessons from the Great Depression: a financial system in distress requires active central bank intervention. Thus, when the need arose, and in the absence of an appropriate policy response by the governments, the ECB stepped in decisively to restore market confidence, contain the sovereign debt crisis and support the euro area economy, by safeguarding price and financial stability. The ECB used the asset side of its balance sheet, as well as other tools such as forward guidance, in addition to its standard and non-standard interest rate policies. Given the success of these policies, some of these instruments will be permanently included in the new standard framework, as the effective lower bound will likely continue to be a binding constraint on interest rate policy in a low inflation, low interest rate environment. Indeed, earlier this month, following subdued inflation, a downward revision of inflation forecasts and weakening euro area growth, the Governing Council of the ECB decided to adopt an even more accommodative monetary policy with an even lower deposit facility rate, a new net Asset Purchase Programme (APP), more favourable terms for TLTRO-III and a new forward guidance.\\nEuro area governments took a number of necessary actions to safeguard the stability of the financial system and to strengthen EMU. Policy actions have focused on addressing institutional weaknesses, structural fragilities and excessive risk-taking that led to the sovereign debt crisis and the negative feedback loop between sovereigns and banks, which in turn undermined euro area stability. Other steps taken involved not only more effective regulation, but also higher capital and liquidity buffers for banks, early warning systems and the development of macro-prudential tools to increase resilience to potential shocks.\\nThe eruption of the Greek crisis as well as the crisis in other Member States acted as a catalyst for key initiatives such as the provision of intergovernmental loans to Greece; the establishment of the EFSF (European Financial Stability Facility), and its successor the ESM (European Stability Mechanism). Other initiatives, which stemmed mainly from the world banking crisis, included: the creation of the Banking Union with the Single Supervisory Mechanism, the Single Resolution Mechanism and the - yet to be created - European Deposit Insurance Scheme; the introduction of stricter rules on banking regulation and supervision as well as the establishment of the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB). Finally, the European Commission proceeded with the development of appropriate macro-prudential tools, which allowed for greater emphasis on identifying and addressing system-wide risks; the strengthening of the Stability and Growth Pact; the initiation of the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure and the European Semester.\\nAs a result of the above initiatives, all Member States that had received EU-IMF assistance are now back on their feet, macroeconomic imbalances have been corrected to a large extent, and growth has been restored. Economic expansion in the euro area as a whole continues, albeit at a slower pace, and EU banks have become more resilient to financial shocks over the past two years, as reflected in the results of the EU-wide stress tests. Moreover, four additional Member States were admitted to EMU during the crisis years.\\nDespite the progress achieved so far, the euro area faces several challenges ahead. The recovery of the euro area from the financial crisis lags behind the recovery of its global competitors. This reflects weak productivity performance and a lagging behind in innovation and digital technologies. Population ageing and climate change raise serious concerns about the longer-term outlook of the euro area economy. Post-crisis, we have seen a halt in financial integration, which weakens private risk-sharing in the euro area. According to a recent IMF discussion note, and in accordance to what has already been said, businesses in Greece pay a 2.5 percent higher rate of interest on their debt than similar businesses in the same industry in France. Moreover, for every one percentage point drop in national GDP growth, consumption drops by 0.75 percentage points, on average, in the euro area Member States, compared to only 0.18 percentage points, on average, in the United States. Economic convergence in terms of real GDP per capita among the 12 old euro area countries (EA12) has stopped since 2010. Only the new euro area Member States have showed sustained convergence. Divergence has widened also in terms of unemployment rates and income inequality indicators.\\nb) Further policy steps to deepen EMU\\nBold steps need to be taken to strengthen the euro area. In the financial sector, it is a priority to complete the Banking Union by creating the European Deposit Insur"

        "title": "Mario Draghi: ECB press conference - introductory statement",
        "content": "Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the Commission Vice-President, Mr Dombrovskis, and the incoming President, Ms Lagarde.\\nBased on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We expect them to remain at their present or lower levels until we have seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within our projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics.\\nAs decided at our last meeting in September, we will restart net purchases under our asset purchase programme (APP) at a monthly pace of \\u20ac20 billion as from 1 November. We expect them to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of our policy rates, and to end shortly before we start raising the key ECB interest rates.\\nWe also intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.\\nThe Governing Council reiterated the need for a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy for a prolonged period of time to support underlying inflation pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term. In particular, the Governing Council's forward guidance will ensure that financial conditions adjust in accordance with changes to the inflation outlook. In any case, the Governing Council continues to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.\\nThe incoming data since the last Governing Council meeting in early September confirm our previous assessment of a protracted weakness in euro area growth dynamics, the persistence of prominent downside risks and muted inflation pressures. At the same time, ongoing employment growth and increasing wages continue to underpin the resilience of the euro area economy. The comprehensive package of policy measures that we decided at our last meeting provides substantial monetary stimulus, which will contribute to a further easing in borrowing conditions for firms and households. This will support the euro area expansion, the ongoing build-up of domestic price pressures and, thus, the sustained convergence of inflation to our medium-term inflation aim.\\nLet me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro area real GDP growth was confirmed at 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2019, following a rise of 0.4% in the previous quarter. Incoming economic data and survey information continue to point to moderate but positive growth in the second half of this year. This slowdown in growth mainly reflects the ongoing weakness of international trade in an environment of persistent global uncertainties, which continue to weigh on the euro area manufacturing sector and are dampening investment growth.\\nAt the same time, the services and construction sectors remain resilient, despite some moderation. The euro area expansion is supported by favourable financing conditions, further employment gains in conjunction with rising wages, the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance and the ongoing - albeit somewhat slower - growth in global activity.\\nThe risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain on the downside. In particular, these risks pertain to the prolonged presence of uncertainties, related to geopolitical factors, rising protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets.\\nEuro area annual HICP inflation decreased from 1.0% in August 2019 to 0.8% in September, reflecting lower food and energy price inflation. On the basis of current futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to decline slightly further before rising again at the end of the year. Measures of underlying inflation remained generally muted and indicators of inflation expectations stand at low levels. While labour cost pressures have strengthened amid tighter labour markets, the weaker growth momentum is delaying their pass-through to inflation. Over the medium term inflation is expected to increase, supported by our monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion and robust wage growth.\\nTurning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth increased to 5.7% in August 2019, after 5.1% in July. Sustained rates of broad money growth reflect ongoing bank credit creation for the private sector and low opportunity costs of holding M3. The narrow monetary aggregate M1 continues to be the main contributor to broad money growth on the components side.\\nThe growth of loans to firms and households remained solid, benefiting from the continued pass-through of our accommodative monetary policy stance to bank lending rates. The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations increased to 4.3% in August, from 4.0% in July 2019, while the annual growth rate of loans to households remained unchanged at 3.4% in August. The euro area bank lending survey for the third quarter of 2019 indicates a slight easing of credit standards and increasing demand for loans to households, while demand for loans to firms remained broadly stable. Our accommodative monetary policy stance will help to safeguard favourable bank lending conditions and will continue to support access to financing, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises.\\nTo sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is still necessary for the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.\\nIn order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute more decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential, supporting aggregate demand at the current juncture and reducing vulnerabilities. The implementation of structural policies in euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up to boost euro area productivity and growth potential, reduce structural unemployment and increase resilience. The 2019 country-specific recommendations should serve as the relevant signpost.\\nRegarding fiscal policies, the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance is currently providing some support to economic activity. In view of the weakening economic outlook and the continued prominence of downside risks, governments with fiscal space should act in an effective and timely manner. In countries where public debt is high, governments need to pursue prudent policies and meet structural balance targets, which will create the conditions for automatic stabilisers to operate freely. All countries should intensify their efforts to achieve a more growth-friendly composition of public finances.\\nLikewise, the transparent and consistent implementation of the European Union's fiscal and economic governance framework over time and across countries remains essential to bolster the resilience of the euro area economy. Improving the functioning of Economic and Monetary Union remains a priority. The Governing Council welcomes the ongoing work and urges further specific and decisive steps to complete the banking union and the capital markets union.\\nWe are now at your disposal for questions."

        "content": "As prepared for delivery\\nDear Mario, dear friends,\\nAs the longest serving Governor of a national central bank in the Governing Council, I have been awarded the privilege and honour to say a few words at Mario's farewell dinner. \\nWhen Mario took office as President of the ECB eight years ago, Europe was diving deep into the sovereign debt crisis. Financial markets questioned the ability of highly indebted euro area countries to pay back their debts. A break up of the euro was a real possibility and redenomination risk premia appeared. \\nEight years have passed, the euro is here to stay, and rests on much stronger foundations. \\nMario\\xb4s contribution to this outcome cannot be overemphasised. His leadership as President of the ECB has shown a remarkable ability:\\nTo evaluate the context;\\nTo separate what is essential from what is secondary; \\nTo build consensus within the ECB's Governing Council to pursue the required unconventional policies;\\nAnd last, but not least, to convince European leaders of the need to strengthen the foundations of the EMU. Mario provided impetus to the creation of the Banking Union, and took upon the ECB the task of setting up the Single Supervisory Mechanism. \\nMario has had the courage to search for solutions that tested the limits of our common mandate, while being open and flexible on how to achieve it. In doing so, he had to cope with a lack of understanding by important sectors of public opinion.\\nWith its balanced and determined decisions to define the Outright Monetary Transactions mechanism and to provide conditional financing to the Greek banking system, the ECB effectively saved the euro. \\nWith its bold unconventional policies, the ECB effectively prevented the euro area from sliding into deflation. It also allowed the time for political agents to adjust their fiscal policies, to adopt structural measures and to agree on institutional improvements needed for a sustainable Economic and Monetary Union.\\nMario has proven to be intellectually curious and open, looking at facts and questioning theories. He has instilled mental discipline among all of us working with him, and throughout the ECB. Without annulling differences in opinion, Mario was able to make us converge to a common course of action.\\nMario, dear President, \\nYou understood the problems we were confronted with like few others; \\nYou had the courage and the sense of urgency that the situation required; \\nYou showed the authority, the expertise and the resolve to act decisively;\\nYou were able to think - and act - out of the box, exploring the room for manoeuvre provided by the EU Treaty and our Statute;\\nIn brief, you were always ahead of the curve. What better definition could we have of a true leader?\\nSo, Mario:\\nThank you for your vision and your genius intuition; \\nThank you for your bold and skilful leadership of the European Central Bank;\\nThank you for leaving us a credible, mature and independent ECB, fully committed to its price stability and bank supervision mandates;\\nAnd, coming from a country that underwent such a profound crisis, thank you for the support you - and the ECB under your leadership - extended to us. It made a difference, it still does.\\nOn a more personal note, and I finish here, I cannot thank you enough for the trust and solidarity you showed me two years ago. Portugal was being ravaged by wildfires, and many advised you to cancel that year's ECB forum in Sintra. Following my assurances, you decided to go ahead with the forum. A different decision would have been an enormous blow not only for Portugal, but also to the ECB forum. Once again, you were proven right. \\nThank You, Mario!"

A very good afternoon to you all and let me extend my warm greetings and welcome you to the 19th Annual working luncheon of the Ghana Association of Bankers (GAB). It is indeed a great pleasure to be invited to address this working luncheon of the Ghana Association of Bankers, bringing together Chief Executives of Banks in Ghana.\\n2. To begin, allow me to highlight the critical role of the banking sector to the national development agenda. The growth experience of the banking industry is necessarily intertwined with that of the economy as a whole. And the industry has necessarily been central to economic policy and structural reforms because a sound and efficient banking system is indispensable for financial stability and indispensable for a healthy and robust economy.\\n3. Mr. Chairman, we have gathered here at a time of completion of actions to reform our financial sector and a time when a lot of gains have been made in country's monetary and financial stability, and confidence is being restored. These gains should begin to translate into lower interest rates that Ghana pays for issuing debt, as well as lead to further anchoring of inflation expectations at the low and stable levels and financial stability."

I avoided the temptation to list all of the things we've done to facilitate competition and instead posed a set of seven questions which I think are more awkward for us.\\nThe three-line version of that speech is this: we've done a lot to lower prudential barriers to entry into the banking sector, with the result that we've got a lot of new banks. But have we done enough to lower the equivalent barriers to growth, given no little bank has recently become a really big bank?\\nSince then I have unleashed the competition team within the PRA to roam about the institution digging up whatever they can find on the barriers to growth issue. They have already come up with two things. First, with the help of a PRA robot they have for the first time been able to map all the barriers, and show how complex our rules are. And second, together with our credit union supervisors they have taken a fresh look at capital requirements for that sector and proposed some quite radical changes in order to promote the growth of successful firms."

        "content": "Ladies and Gentlemen,\\nI would like to thank Ms. de la Raudi\\xe8re for her invitation to this conference, which reflects the financial community's ever growing interest in the ongoing evolution of the banking and financial system. The organisers of this conference asked me to give you my perspective as central banker and supervisor on the complex issues involved in the boom of digitisation in the financial sector.\\nI will attempt to meet this challenge, by first observing that, for some years now, Europe has entered a world where digital technology is profoundly changing the business models of many economic sectors. The banking and financial sector is no exception. New players are entering the market with new proposals, more suited to the uses and requirements of the \"digital\" consumer. They challenge established players by fragmenting a traditionally highly integrated value chain. The first of these new entrants are FinTechs. These start-ups are able to outperform the historical players on a link in the value chain, providing new services to consumers or reducing costs. The second are BigTechs. They rely on huge amounts of data and their experience of how to deal with them; by taking advantage of network effects, they are starting to attack strategic links in this value chain (services with high technological added value and sometimes customer relations) in order to be able to offer new profit generating activities. Thanks to their dominance of certain sectors - let us take the example of cloud computing - and to their ability to expand - their cash reserves enable them to penetrate a market, to dominate it and to use technology to set up barriers to entry - these new entrants are giving rise to a significant risk of dependency, or even captivity, for established financial players. While BigTechs today are, at least in Europe, subcontractors of banks and insurance companies, we cannot rule out a reversal of business models which would confine financial institutions to the role of specialised service providers: credit origination, middle and back office, compliance.\\nThese prospects raise several questions in terms of European sovereignty: how can we effectively protect citizens' data (be they payment or personal data) and offer them real control over their use? How, in a global ecosystem with ever more open architectures, can we increase the strength and resilience of the financial system in the face of cyber risks? How can we encourage the development of pan-European payment solutions in the face of rising competition from non-European players in the payment solutions segment? In the fight against money laundering and the financing of terrorism (AML-CFT), how can we respond effectively to the challenge posed by crypto-assets, many of which were designed on the principle of anonymity and the bypassing of the rule of law? Finally, a question addressed more directly to me, as central banker and supervisor: how can we consider exercising our regulatory missions in a financial sector whose contours and functioning are undergoing change?\\nIn my opinion, appropriate responses to these questions must be based on three pillars: (i) a clear assessment, (ii) a sufficiently open mind to propose frameworks adapted to new paradigms and (iii) the collective boldness to innovate. And I would like to share with you some thoughts on these three topics.\\n (i) Assessment\\nThe digital revolution now enables some companies to rely on a potential customer base equivalent to the combined population of Europe, the United States and China, in order to make significant incursions, and potentially systemic ones, currently mainly in the field of payments and fund transfers.\\nThe magnitude of these network effects and the speed at which they can be exploited are likely to radically alter the scope and intensity of competition in the markets in which they are present. They can also contribute to exacerbating not only the size of the benefits but also the risks that they create for the stability of the financial system and monetary stability. Should this prospect lead us to seek to preserve the status quo? I see at least two reasons for not going down that road.\\nThe first is that the technologies that allow these changes in scale carry progress. Technological revolutions, from the early stages of the internet to the boom in blockchain protocols to artificial intelligence, have given rise to, and can still continue to do so, new services, many daily improvements for consumers, in particular financial services including, and we are extremely attentive to that, better financial inclusion.\\nSecond, there is no reason to assume that the current framework for regulating financial services is intangible and cannot be adjusted to respond to changes, including in scale, brought about by technological innovation to ensure that potential risks are properly managed. A simple example: the customer experience for opening a remote account in France, compared to other European countries, wasn't sufficiently fluid. The players that we have met often mentioned as a potential impediment the French transposition of the 4th European anti-money laundering directive, which would not make it possible to fully capitalise on the advantages of technology. We have taken note of the problem and set up a working group, led by the ACPR Fintech - Innovation unit within the framework of the ACPR-AMF Fintech Forum, bringing together technology providers, financial institutions and public authorities. The aim was to co-construct proposals based on an objective assessment of regulations and technological state of the art, while ensuring the efficiency of AML/CFT frameworks. The result is that these proposals have almost all been adopted for the transposition of the 5th directive. We know how to think outside the box when necessary. However, to maintain a smooth risk management for projects that are likely to exploit huge network effects, and thus likely to create significant risks to financial and monetary stability, it would be prudent to ensure that regulation frameworks are perfectly tailored to the risks posed before rolling out these projects in the market.\\nIn order to help complete the adjustment of the regulatory and supervisory framework to these profound changes, central banks and supervisors first have the advantage of their legitimacy, which is primarily due to their institutional mandates: prudential supervision, financial stability, and conduct of monetary policy. Their legitimacy is also rooted in their experience of crises and their contributions to solving them. However, to live up to this legitimacy, it is up to the public authorities to identify the new risks, both in terms of their nature and magnitude, and to provide clear, strong and relevant responses.\\n(ii) An open mind is necessary to achieve this objective: it must lead us to propose frameworks that are tailored to the new challenges and associated risks.\\nThe specificities of the changes brought about by the digital revolution and in particular the multinational scope of the resulting network effects also require us to advocate for a reinforcement of international cooperation between authorities in order to ensure a better coherence of the national regulatory frameworks and to propose changes that affect global governance. To illustrate this point, I will choose an example outside the financial sector: that of the general regulation on the protection of personal data (RGPD). By setting up a common framework for the protection and circulation of personal data, the European Union has not only harmonised its regulations and reaffirmed its own values, but has also defined a global reference in this area, raising interest among many partners, in particular the United States, shaken by repeated scandals whose symbol remains Cambridge Analytica.\\nIn my view, our proposals and actions should be guided by two principles.\\nFirst of all, we need to think in terms of an open system. We must take into account the development of interactions of all kinds between the participants in the various \"ecosystems\" on which the development of financial services is now based. It is a prerequisite for being able to legitimately claim to regulate interconnections. It is also a prerequisite for ensuring an appropriate perimeter for the regulations to be adapted as well as the coordination and coherence at national, European and international level of these adaptations.\\nTo be more concrete, let us take the example of Open Banking. The regulatory framework set out by the second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) has lifted the technical and legal barriers to accessing payment account data. The immediate consequence has been the development of a new ecosystem offering consumers a wealth of new services. However, we have also imposed high data protection requirements at the European level, in particular in the rules governing access to this information.\\nSecond principle: in order not to be mere spectators of change or react to it too late, we must fully take on the prospective observation, experimentation, and operational commitment. In the area of payments, the recent BigTech initiatives with a global impact have once again brought the current inefficiency of cross-border payment solutions to the forefront. However, the issues of financial stability, monetary policy and sovereignty raised by these projects should encourage us to operationalise our efforts to promote more efficient payment systems where appropriate by considering an operational involvement of central banks, based on the consistent and coordinated use of new technologies.\\nAs regards infrastructures, we have taken an interest in blockchain technology since its early stages. We were the first central bank to develop, regarding the specific use of SEPA creditor credentials, a decentralised register system based on a blockchain protocol, the \"MADRE\" register. Of course, this is only a first step, which does not exhaust an extremely vast and diversified field of experimentation. The question that arises today is: which systems could become more efficient or offer greater possibilities as a result of technical decentralisation?\\nIn the field of regulation and supervision conducted by the ACPR, we applied the same principles. Take the case of Artificial Intelligence (AI). How do we concretely define the conditions for a controlled development of artificial intelligence and define the principles of its control? It is in this spirit that we designed our IA workshops: the ACPR FinTech experts and the Banque de France data scientists met established players to understand their perception of these technologies and assess their level of maturity. In the areas of AML-CFT, internal models and consumer protection, the lessons learned from these meetings and tests under production conditions will provide us with crucial information for building a future framework conducive to controlling the development of Artificial Intelligence.\\n (iii) Aware of the importance of the issues and clairvoyant as to their complexity, ready to change our regulation and the exercise of our missions, we must also be bold, that is to say, innovative. To conclude this speech, I would like to stress two important elements.\\nFirst, European financial sovereignty does not depend solely on the authorities of its Member States or on the regulations drawn up by the European Commission; it depends first and foremost on the vitality of the European ecosystem and on the innovation effort of all players, be they established or new. In this regard, the Europe of payments should seize the opportunity offered by the digital revolution to develop a pan-European payment solution. Our institutions are an integral component of this European ecosystem and intend to play their full part in it: the Banque de France Lab, the ACPR Fintech-Innovation unit, with its joint ACPR-AMF Fintech Forum, and all public authorities, are fully mobilised to support the expansion and growth of this ecosystem.\\nSecond, we also apply this injunction to innovate to ourselves: we can only achieve our objectives and truly support the market if we ourselves are innovative. In this respect, our projects are and must remain numerous. I have already mentioned MADRE, I would like to make a special mention of our analysis of \"weak signals\" by artificial intelligence, to detect fragile companies. This project is remarkable by the cooperation that it involves between a wide variety of public players: the Direction g\\xe9n\\xe9rale des entreprises (DGE), the D\\xe9l\\xe9gation g\\xe9n\\xe9rale \\xe0 l'emploi et \\xe0 la formation professionnelle (DGEFP), the Agence centrale des organismes de s\\xe9curit\\xe9 sociale (ACOSS) and the Direction interminist\\xe9rielle du num\\xe9rique et du syst\\xe8me d'information et de communication de l'\\xc9tat (DINSIC) and of course the Banque de France.\\nOur search for innovation also means innovation in work methods and project implementation: intrapreneurship, which we have set up at the ACPR, is a good illustration of this. The idea is to mobilise all employees, in order to bring out the innovations that are most suited to our missions and then have them implemented by \"intrapreneurs\", who are bestowed with great autonomy, comparable to that of start-uppers, for the development of their project. Our first intrapreneurship programme will enable us, I hope, to benefit within 9 months to a year from artificial intelligence tools to conduct our supervisory missions.\\nAll of these initiatives are as vital as they are exciting. They are the DNA of our institutions, and I am convinced, the reflection of that of the French and European ecosystem.\\nThank you for your attention."

        "title": "Benjamin E Diokno: Financial inclusion - a social mandate ",
        "content": "Esteemed members of the financial community, it is my pleasure to give this keynote address at your 2019 Conference.\\nYour theme \"Riding on the Opportunities of the Next Digital Wave\" is very timely as we are in fact in this wave.\\nIt is also very relevant to the topic of this keynote address which is \"Financial Inclusion as A Social Mandate.\"\\nThe Fourth Industrial Revolution is upon us. This advent of \"cyber-physical systems\" represents new ways in which technology has embedded itself within societies and even our human bodies. It affects many aspects of business, society, and even day-to-day life in a significant way.\\nIn fact, technology is now in the hands of everyone. Who among you remember the car-based mobile phone service of PLDT in the mid-80s? This technology, which was available to only a few in the 80s, has now grown to 124.2 million mobile connections in the Philippines. \\nToday-because of digitalization-anyone with a smartphone and internet connection can easily access information about almost anything under the sun in a matter of seconds.\\nMany of these technological advancements are now part of our day-to-day reality such as online streaming, electric vehicles, EMV chip cards, and social media.\\nHowever, despite favorable developments due to technology, many challenges persist. There is uneven access and the people who should benefit the most from new technologies are the ones who are still left behind.\\nWe see a similar gap in terms of the state of financial inclusion in the country. Those who are in most need of financial products and services are the ones who are mainly unserved and underserved.\\nBased on the 2017 Financial Inclusion Survey, only 23% of Filipino adults have a formal account. Only 48% of adults save, but 7 in 10 savers keep their savings at home. Of the 22% of Filipino adults who avail loans, 4 in 10 do so through informal sources.\\nAs such, it is necessary to bring the unserved and underserved into the national economy.\\nThe signing into law of Republic Act (RA) No. 11211 of 2019 amending the BSP charter elevates financial inclusion and its complementary objectives of financial literacy and consumer protection from advocacies to an institutional imperative. Section 3 states:\\n\"In the attainment of its objectives, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas shall promote broad and convenient access to high quality financial services and consider the interest of the general public.\"\\nIn the Philippine Development Plan 2017-2022 (PDP), financial inclusion indicators, such as the level of account penetration, have been incorporated as part of the impact measurement framework.   \\nMeanwhile, in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by the United General Assembly, financial inclusion is recognized as a key enabler in achieving 13 of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals or SDGs.\\nThe SDGs are 17 goals endorsed by 193 nations to end poverty in all its forms, promote prosperity and people's well-being, reduce inequality, and protect the environment.  \\nThis brings us to the importance of financial inclusion as a social mandate as it plays a critical role in ensuring that the fruits of prosperity are felt by everyone through increased opportunities and better quality of life. \\nFinancial inclusion lays the groundwork for sustainable and equitable national development.  The goal of financial inclusion does not end in providing universal access to financial services but in ensuring that these services truly enhance the well-being of their users. \\nRather than being a mere end in itself, financial inclusion is a means to achieve broader aspirations.  When people are financially included and realize their stake in national prosperity, they are empowered to make better, informed choices when it comes to their financial welfare and future. In turn, they are able to make sound decisions that raise their productivity and standard of living.\\nThe pursuit of financial inclusion requires an openness to all possible transformative solutions and impactful innovations, such as digital technology, new business models, and cross-sector collaboration. \\nBut the pursuit of financial inclusion is not a walk in the park. It requires a concerted and holistic effort. It requires the participation of all key decision makers and stakeholders, from the bank executives to the officers who go out in the field-including those in the expanding fintech industry.\\nGiven the promise of emerging technologies and models, we also consider financial inclusion as one of the biggest potential winners of technological advancement and digitalization. \\nTechnology can increase the breadth and depth of financial inclusion. It can facilitate massive efficiencies that make it possible - and even strategic - for financial service providers to serve low-income and rural clients viably.\\nFor this reason, we are optimizing the applications of technology by directing focus on sectors such as agriculture, as well as countryside development.\\nThese sectors encounter the most difficulty in terms of access; these sectors experience the highest poverty incidence in the country.\\nIn brief, our goal by 2023, is to ensure that at least 70% of adult Filipinos will have access to formal financial services.\\nNeedless to say that digital technology can massively help our financial inclusion agenda.\\nBut we need to deliberately and purposefully harness this potential by ensuring that anyone can readily open and use an account through digital channels for various financial transaction.\\nThe paradigm is that without a transaction account that can be used for digital payments, an individual will not be able to effectively and fully participate in the gains of digital finance. \\nThus, in 2016, the BSP has issued a series of policy issuances centered on three imperatives: first was to ensure availability of a transaction account that is tailored specifically for the unbanked;\\nsecond, was to enable those with an account to use it to affordably and conveniently send and receive money from any account through their mobile phone; and third was to expand the network of access points.\\nAccordingly, we issued the guidelines and incentives for banks to offer basic deposit accounts that have no maintaining balance and an opening deposit not exceeding P100.\\nWe also issued the National Retail Payment System framework which anchored the launch of the PESONet and Instapay to enable faster, safer, and more convenient electronic fund transfers between any accounts held in any participating bank or e-money issuer.  To date, there are 53 participating institutions for PESONet and 44 for InstaPay.\\nLastly, we issued the cash agent regulation which enables banks to use convenience stores, pharmacies, pawnshops, and other retail outlets as low-cost and non-intimidating service points where clients can open an account, make deposits and withdrawals, pay bills and other transactions.\\nFor these regulations and other related policy initiatives, the Economic Intelligence Unit in its 2018 Global Microscope Report cited the BSP for its focus to create an inclusive digital finance ecosystem and the regulatory enablers for financial inclusion. \\nIn fact, for several years now, the Philippines has been recognized as one of the top five countries that have a conducive regulatory environment for financial inclusion.\\nYet, despite these developments, financial exclusion remains significantly high-emphasizing that enabling regulations alone are not sufficient to drive financial inclusion.  \\nTo truly unlock the potential of digital innovations for inclusive finance, we need to build pillars that enable and promote the use of digital finance.\\nThe first pillar is the digital infrastructure. Indeed, digital connectivity is a pre-requisite for digital finance. Yet, speed, affordability, and availability of internet connectivity are important factors that determine adoption of digital finance, particularly in the rural areas.\\nOvercoming the barriers to digital connectivity will not only promote accessibility to digital financial products, but will allow innovators to improve the design, enhance security features, and drive down the cost of financial services.\\nAnother important infrastructure is the digital ID system which is why the BSP is looking forward to the implementation of the Philippine ID System or the Philsys.\\nBeyond its ability to address the lack of identity documents commonly cited as a barrier by the unbanked, the PhilSys through its electronic KYC feature can significantly reduce the cost of onboarding new clients by as much as 80% based on a study commissioned by the Asian Development Bank. Such a digital ID system can also enable the delivery of innovative end-to-end financial services.\\nThe second pillar would be the digital payments use cases.  It is not enough that people are able to easily open a transaction account. People should see the necessity of an account and be able to use that account for various payment transactions on a regular basis.\\nWhat can compel people to open a transaction account?\\nFor the wage earners and informal workers, receiving wages and social benefits is one.\\nBeing able to use a mobile phone to pay market vendors, jeepney drivers, utilities and online purchases is another.\\nThe regular use of transaction accounts will not only catalyze digital payments but also enable the account holder to build a richer digital footprint for his credit profile. This is the focus of our intensified coordination efforts with the Department of Social Welfare and Development, the Department of Labor and Employment, and the Department of Transportation.\\nTo provide the public with digital payment options for transactions with government, we are working closely with the payments industry and the Department of Finance and the Department of Budget Management on the development of a bills payment platform and on possible policies to address implementation barriers.\\nThe third pillar is user trust and readiness. If people do not trust, understand or know how to use digital financial services, people will not use these products even if they are affordable and convenient.\\nTo this end, we are committed to our partnership with various public and private entities to promote financial and digital literacy in the country. We also continue to engage the fintech industry, the Department of Information and Communication Technology and the National Privacy Commission to promote cyber-resilience and data privacy in digital finance.\\nIt is also necessary to provide an accessible venue for consumers to engage the regulators for concerns regarding their use of financial services as a way to build confidence in these products.\\nAnd this is why we have undertaken a chatbot project for consumer complaints and issues handling. I am happy to share that this project, and our regtech project on prudential reporting, have earned the BSP two innovation awards from the Central Banking Publications in Singapore last September 4. \\nIndeed, the imperatives of financial inclusion go beyond enabling regulations and require coordinated programs across the government and private sector.\\nI hope that by explaining these pillars, I was able to give you a sense of the breadth of the work that we need to do and support. I hope that in understanding why financial inclusion matters, you will leave this conference with a genuine interest to find ways on how you and your companies can contribute to financial inclusion.\\nAllow me therefore, before I close, to throw in some ideas. Consider this my call to action for this body.\\nAs businesses, you may be operating in a value or supply chain over which you can exert influence. Examine the actors in these chains; you may have as suppliers or buyers the small businesses, microentrepreneurs and farmer groups. Think of how you can leverage your role in the chain so they can access better credit terms from the banks and other lenders.\\nFor companies that collect customer data, you can explore ways on how you can empower these customers to use their data for their credit profile so they can access better financing. Empower your customers to use their data for welfare-enhancing pursuits.\\nIf there are workers in your supply chain who are paid cash, perhaps you can ensure that they be given a transaction account where they can receive their wages.\\nAnother way that your company or even this body as a collective can support financial inclusion is to advocate with legislators for policies and infrastructure that can help promote access to finance of the SMEs and farmers.\\nFor instance, the warehouse receipts system bill can support farmers by providing them the tools to manage commodity price risks and to access financing using warehouse receipts as collateral.\\nThere's also the financial consumer protection bill that provide all financial sector regulators with the necessary powers to ensure responsible and consumer-friendly conduct of financial service providers. This is critical especially as more and more products and services are accessed digitally.\\nLastly, and I know Finex is already doing this, we all can help improve financial literacy in this country through various means.\\nMaybe you can organize financial literacy training for your employees and clients. Based on BSP's 2017 survey, only 18% and 3% of adult Filipinos have an insurance and financial investment, respectively.\\nAnother way to support financial literacy is to help develop content and materials that can be used by various government agencies in their finlit programs. You can even develop your own finlit programs for your industry. BSP will be happy to assist in facilitating dialogue and partnerships with various stakeholders within and outside government.\\nIn closing, allow me to share this quote from Leonardo da Vinci: \"I have been impressed with the urgency of doing. Knowing is not enough. We must apply. Being willing is not enough. We must do.\"\\nFinancial inclusion is our shared social mandate. And there is never a better time to act than now. We all have a stake in the future of our country. May it be prosperous not only for a few but for all. \\nA good day to you all. Thank you and mabuhay! "

        "title": "Benjamin E Diokno: The Philippines - structural reforms, macroeconomic performance, moving forward ",
        "content": "Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.\\nLet me extend a warm Filipino welcome to all our guests for joining us in today's Meet and Greet session with the Philippine Embassy and the US-Philippines Society.\\nDuring the International Monetary Fund (IMF)-World Bank (WB) Annual Meetings in 2016, I addressed this audience as the Philippine Budget Secretary. I am pleased to represent the Philippines, this time, as head of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas -a hat I've been wearing for nearly seven months now.\\nDespite this change of roles and mandates for policy formulation, at least two things remain as necessary. First, conversation with and inputs from stakeholders form an important part of the policy making process.\\nAs we are all aware, the threat of slowing global economic growth looms larger than ever on the horizon as protectionist policies and geopolitical tensions continue to dominate the global growth narrative. Nonetheless, the Philippines remains on a very sound footing because: (i) economic growth is solid and sustainable; (ii) inflation is low and manageable; (iii) the external payments position is strong; and (iv) the banking system is strong and stable.  I will describe briefly each of these four points shortly.\\nMEANINGFUL STRUCTURAL REFORMS\\nThe Philippines has come a long way from being the \"Sick man\" of Asia. In fact, the Philippines is now recognized globally as among the fastest growing and most resilient economies in the world that enjoys brighter prospects ahead. The transformation, however, did not happen overnight. The gradual transformation was a product of a long list of structural reforms that started way back in, the 1990s. It did not happen overnight.\\nI remember in the 1990s when a group of economists headed by Paul Krugman came to the Philippines to assess the economy. Their verdict then on the long-term growth of the Philippines was, at best, 3.0 percent. We've come a long way from that dismal assessment. A recent assessment confirm that the Philippine Economy can sustain a long-term growth of 6.5%.\\nWe have deregulated the oil industry, liberalized the power sector, privatized the water services, and acceded to the World Trade Organization. These are just some of the reforms implemented in the 1990s that have been followed through in the succeeding decades and-if I may stress-more aggressively so in the last three (3) years under the Duterte Administration.\\nKey reforms from 2016 onwards are expected to unleash more growth potentials for the Philippines. Among these positive game changers have involved tax reforms, liberalization of rice importation, the national ID system, Universal Healthcare, Universal Access to Tertiary Education, Ease of Doing Business law, relaxation of the Foreign Investments Negative List (FINL), and the revised Corporation Code-just to name a few.\\nThe newly amended BSP Charter in 2019 has also strengthened the BSP's capacity to better safeguard price and financial stability, and to promote an efficient payments and settlements system amidst a growing economy and the increasing sophistication of the financial system.\\nAll these reforms should support and sustain the currently favorable conditions of the economy, summarized by the four key observations I mentioned earlier. Let me expound of these at this point.\\nPHILIPPINE MACROECONOMIC PERFORMANCE\\nFirst, solid and sustainable economic growth. The Philippines recorded its 82nd consecutive quarter or roughly more than twenty years of uninterrupted economic growth in the second quarter of 2019. This shows that we have managed to sail through the toughest external challenges from the Asian financial crisis to the Global financial crisis.\\nOn the production side, economic growth was propelled mainly by the robust performance of the services sector. Meanwhile, broad-based expansion in household consumption and government spending reinforced growth on the demand side.\\nThe Build, Build, Build program ushers in the country's Golden Age of Infrastructure, giving additional solid push for the economy's productive capacity to expand further.\\nSecond, domestic inflation is within-target. After posting successive multi-year highs that culminated in a 6.7 percent nine-year peak in September and October, inflation has slowed considerably and reverted to within the target range of 2.0 to 4.0 percent. This is credited to a series of monetary actions by the BSP that addressed brewing second-round effects combined with and non-monetary actions by the government that addressed bottlenecks to food supply.\\nThe decelerating trend in inflation, which fell to 0.9 percent in September, has allowed us to reduce the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) facility by 75 basis points so far this year to 4.0 percent. The rate cuts were aimed at helping inflation move towards the middle of the target range, in line with the BSP's flexible approach to inflation targeting.\\nIn terms of the BSP's outlook for inflation, our latest baseline projections in September show inflation settling within the target range of 3.0 percent \\xb1 1.0 percentage point for both 2019 and 2020.\\nThird, the country's external position is reflective of an economy driven by solid macroeconomic fundamentals and firm growth prospects. Based on the latest estimates, the country's balance of payments (BOP) position for the first eight (8) months of the year posted a surplus of US$5.5 billion, a turnaround from the US$2.4 billion deficit recorded in the same period last year.\\nFor Q2 2019, the current account registered a deficit of US$145 million, a 95.6 percent reduction from the US$3.3 billion deficit registered in the same quarter in 2018. This developed on account mainly of the lower deficit in the trade-in-goods account. Increased net receipts trade-in-services, and secondary and in the primary income also contributed to the improvement of the current account in the second quarter of the year.\\nDriving this surplus includes reliable inflows from Overseas Filipinos' (OF) remittances and net inflows of portfolio investments during the first half of the year.\\nForeign direct investments (FDIs) in the last two (2) years have also lent support to the country's external account along with rising investor confidence.\\nMeanwhile, after falling by 1.8 percent, year-on-year in 2018 exports begun to recover slightly, edging up to $40.391 billion in the first seven (7) months in 2019.  July itself marked the fourth straight month of export growth at 3.5 percent.\\nThese steady inflows of foreign exchange helped raise gross international reserves (GIR) to an all-time high of US$86.2 billion in September 2019, providing ample external liquidity buffer.\\nAt this level, the GIR can cover up to 7.5 months' worth of imports of goods and payments of services and primary income. The rule of thumb is that a sufficient GIR level can cover three (3) months' worth of imports of goods and payments.\\nMy fourth and last point - a strong and stable banking system - also offers a sound basis for optimism. Our financial system remains sound and continues to effectively intermediate funds to productive sectors, thus promoting economic growth. The continued strong credit activities demonstrate the effectiveness of Philippine banks in their role as intermediator of funds in the economy.\\nBanks remain sufficiently capitalized and past due ratios have also consistently declined over the years, giving banks greater ability to intermediate funds, manage risk, and maintain profitability.\\nThe stability and soundness of the banking system is being supported as well by the financial sector reform agenda of the BSP focusing on areas such as banking supervision; cybersecurity and technology risk management; anti-money laundering; counter-terrorist financing; and capital market development.\\nOur financial system remains sound and continues to effectively intermediate funds to productive sectors, thus promoting economic growth.\\nThe banking system likewise exhibits robust financial intermediation activity as its double-digit growth in bank lending helps support not only household consumption but also business activities, such as those in real estate, trade, manufacturing, and construction, among other sectors.\\nMOVING FORWARD\\nIn sum, the country has been making considerable progress towards achieving its macroeconomic goals. Looking ahead, prospects for the domestic economy continue to remain favorable as domestic growth fundamentals are expected to remain intact. GDP expansion is expected to continue to pick up in 2019 due to the robust growth in the services and industry sectors.  Private demand is expected to remain firm, aided mainly by sustained remittance inflows and stable inflation. As more government infrastructure programs get underway, the positive spillover effects on private capital formation would also contribute to economic growth.\\nFrom this position of strength, the BSP remains committed to continually upholding the highest standard of excellence in crafting policies, and thereby achieve our mandates.\\nGoing forward, the BSP will continue to monitor price and output conditions to ensure that monetary policy remains appropriately supportive of sustained non-inflationary economic growth over the medium term. We will be even more proactive in promoting a regulatory environment that enables growth and innovation among banks and, at the same time, enhancing their ability to manage risks.\\nAdmittedly, the Philippine economy is not immune from risks arising from external factors. The global economic slowdown brought about largely by US-China trade tension and growing protection affect us all. But we are confident that the Philippines will be one of the least affected economies because its growth is based on strong domestic demand and the economy is not export-oriented.\\nMany studies support this view that the Philippines will be one of the most resilient economies in this slowing and turbulent global economy.\\nHaving said all these, I am looking forward to a productive and stimulating discussion with you and will be receptive to your insights.\\nThank you and mabuhay!"

        "title": "Yaron Amir: Setting goals and embracing innovation to meet the challenges of a changing environment",
        "content": "Good evening.\\nI am very happy to have the opportunity to sit here today with three of my predecessors and to discuss core central banking issues-I cannot think of a more appropriate group with whom to hold such a discussion. There is no need for me to introduce the previous governors, but nonetheless, it is important not to take for granted their achievements, which placed the Bank of Israel at the forefront of economic activity in Israel and in central banking worldwide, and strengthened the Israeli economy, its stability and its robustness. They led us to the situation in which we can today take the steps necessary to prepare the economy for the challenges of the future.\\nProf. Jacob Frenkel was the stabilizing Governor, who drove forward the foreign exchange market liberalization. When he took office, there were those who thought that after we had succeeded in eliminating the hyperinflation of the 1980s, a further decline from the level of 20 percent to a lower level was not worth the cost involved. Jacob led an extended, persistent and committed process, at the end of which Israel reached low inflation, and the economy benefited from stability and certainty for many years in that area. As you know, today we are dealing with inflation that is slightly lower than the target (perhaps it would have been better to work just a drop less, Jacob). Today it is clear to all that this effort was worth it in the long run. Jacob conducted the liberalization process in the foreign exchange market and in the balance of payments, and thanks to him, the overall economy benefits from full openness of the foreign exchange market and from the free flow of funds between the domestic economy and abroad.\\nProf. Stanley Fischer is the Governor who successfully withstood the global crisis. Under his leadership, and while the global economy trembled, the Bank of Israel was an island of stability, judgment, original thinking, and brave actions, which instilled confidence in market participants, companies, and the general public, and was one of the factors in Israel's economy being among those that suffered less from the global crisis. Stan determinedly led the legislation of the new Bank of Israel Law, in the framework of which, in contrast to human nature, he led the process of cutting the powers of the Governor, who until that change was almost all-powerful. Due to him, monetary policy decisions today are reached by a committee, which enhances the public legitimacy and the independence of the Bank of Israel in reaching decisions. The Bank also operates, from an administrative perspective, under the watchful eye and guidance of the Supervisory Council. These and other changes did not make the lives of the Governors who succeeded him easier (and I'm not complaining, Stanley-not yet), but they improved and strengthened the functioning of the Bank of Israel.\\nProf. Karnit Flug was the Governor who grabbed the bull by the horns and dealt with the fundamental problems of the Israeli economy. Karnit put on the table, clearly, the problem of the Israeli economy's low productivity-maybe the factor that will have the most impact on the welfare of Israel's citizens in the coming decades. Due to a series of research studies and analyses carried out during her term in office, today everyone is able to point to the problem. Karnit's term was characterized by a significant reform in the financial system. Under her leadership, the Bank took on itself the establishment of the Credit Data System, which we launched five months ago; the Bank collaborated with the Ministry of Finance and other entities in designing, legislating, and carrying out the reform to enhance the competition in banking. With the clear recognition of the importance of financial stability, Karnit insisted on promoting the legislation of the Financial Stability Committee, which is an important infrastructure in reducing risks if and when a crisis occurs.\\nSo immense thanks to you, my predecessors, and of course thank you as well to Globes for the distinguished platform you have gathered here. I will take this opportunity to tell my predecessors, and the public, about what has been going on at the Bank of Israel since I took office, and about our plans for the future.\\nThe economic world as we knew it is undergoing great changes. In order to continue to function in a changing environment, and to know how to optimally advance in the face of potential crises, we have to speak, think, and breathe technological, financial, and research-related innovation.\\nIn the first months of my term, we completed several processes that had begun in previous years. As I noted, we went live with the Credit Data System, which is operating satisfactorily. A large number of financial entities, including those not obligated by law, joined the system and began reporting to it and receiving data from it. We also set out the separation of two credit card companies, while ensuring that the parameters of the separation support the goals of the reform. I am also happy to update that the Financial Stability Committee has already met several times and is making progress with the formulation of its tools and work procedures. We presented to the government an extensive and clear analysis on the need to carry out fiscal adjustments. In parallel, we presented a plan to improve the standard of living and productivity in the economy-with an emphasis on operative policy proposals.\\nWe are not blind to the housing issue, and its impact on the young generation. Therefore, I asked the Research Department to begin formulating operative recommendations in the housing area, in order to help the new government identify the order of priorities and to act to remove obstacles that weigh on increasing the supply of homes.\\nIn a joint initiative with the IMF, we are developing a new macroeconomic model, which takes into account two sectors that to date have not been included in the common models-the housing market and the financial system. Recall that these two were among the main factors in the 2008 crisis. The model will serve us in macro assessments but will also contribute to the work of the Financial Stability Committee. In another joint initiative with the IMF, we are working on an international conference on cyber risk in the financial and banking system, with the understanding that looking forward, this is one of the main risks to financial stability.\\nGiven the changes in the global economy, and with eyes to the future, I initiated a strategic process to define the Bank's goals for the coming years. The entire management has been enlisted in this process, which is being conducted by the Director General of the Bank, Hezi Kalo. It is not straightforward to carry out such a process in the midst of the ongoing work that is always very intensive, but it was clear to me that we must look beyond the immediate issues. Therefore, we added a slogan to the process-\"Working today, thinking about tomorrow\". I asked the members of management to think outside the box, and to try to identify the important challenges that the Bank of Israel and the Israeli economy will deal with in the coming years. To that end, we set up several teams, with the participation of tens of staff and managers, in all the relevant areas:\\nThe first deals with monetary policy in the modern era, and asks the big questions. In view of the changes in the global and domestic economies, and in view of the changes that are likely to occur in the structure of money in the modern age, it is crucial to understand how monetary policy should be conducted and what is the toolbox required to do so. Thus, already in the coming year we intend to carry out a process of rethinking the monetary policy framework, and we have already invited senior officials from central banks around the world to come to Israel and participate in a conference we plan to hold on the issue. It is certainly possible that at the end of the process we will reach the conclusion that the current regime is the correct one and there is no need to change it, but we must challenge that thinking from all sides before reaching that conclusion.\\nAnother team is dealing with the financial system of the future, and how to prepare for the changes expected in it. The team is formulating a strategy, the goal of which is to maintain financial stability while aligning the financial and regulatory system to the changing environment, enhancing competition, and implementing innovation. The technological developments that are changing the financial system were at the core of the team's work, as were the challenges deriving from the growth in the number of type of participants in the system, alongside questions raised regarding the role of the Bank of Israel as a main factor in the financial system and in the capital market overall.\\nThe third team is having a ball. It is focused on advanced technologies in the digital era. The team thought about the effects of the digital era on financial infrastructures-open banking, blockchain, digital currencies, and the need to update the payment systems in the economy to an immediate and fast payment system-an area in which Israel lags behind the global frontier. They discussed the contribution of the fintech industry to the Israeli economy, how innovation can be promoted in the financial system and in the economy overall, as well as how to change the Bank itself into a digital and innovative organization.\\nAnyone who knows me knows that I live and breathe research and data. The fourth team that we established deals with that. I'm afraid that since I took office I have caused more than a few white hairs among the excellent people in the Bank's Research Department and the Information and Statistics Department, with the requirements and requests I set for them. The statistical data are among the main building blocks in a central bank's work. Looking ahead, there will be a need to collect new data of various types from new sources. Big data, visual data, audio-visual, geographic data, artificial intelligence-these are all areas that are being developed at a rapid pace and the Bank will have to examine how to derive the maximum from them in order to fulfill its various functions, and how to make the data accessible to the public in the most efficient and convenient manner.\\nWe are also looking inward-to the human resource-the most important asset a central bank has. We are comprehensively examining our operational setup, what strategy will ensure the adequate inputs for carrying out the Bank's functions over time; and our communication with the public-whether, and how, to adjust how we explain ourselves to the public in view of the sharp changes occurring in the world in communication in general, and in how central banks communicate with the public in particular.\\nThis process is complex and comprehensive. Our goal is to question every convention, and to leave no stone unturned. And obviously, our test will be in the implementation. In view of how the entire bank was enlisted into this process, I am sure that ultimately the Bank will be better prepared to fulfill its objectives optimally, in view of our upcoming challenges over the coming years.\\nAnd from these lofty ideas, let's move for a moment to some current issues.\\nAs you know, last week the Monetary Committee decided to keep the interest rate unchanged, though it conveyed a different message than the one we conveyed in recent months. The message was changed because the data changed-in central banking jargon that is called data dependency. Within a relatively short period of time, we saw a decline in inflation, a change in the direction of monetary policy worldwide, a worsening of the risks to the global economy, and a relatively sharp appreciation of the shekel. We noted with satisfaction that the domestic economy is in a good situation-and indeed, when looking beyond the technical volatility, we see that the economy is growing at a solid pace, the labor market remains tight, and it appears that to date the slowdown in the global economy is not trickling down to the Israeli economy, not even to exports, which continue to grow, particularly due to services exports.\\nIf the economy is in a good state, why did we note that if necessary we will take steps to make monetary policy more accommodative? First, because the trend of inflation changed. It is not clear to us at this point if it is noise in the data-loud noise, to be sure, but noise-or a fundamental decline in inflation. However, it is clear to us that we have to continue to strive and raise the inflation rate toward the midpoint of the target range. Second, the risks have intensified. Should the risks be realized, we will want to act in a timely manner, in order to prevent to the extent possible a slowdown in economic activity. How will we do that? We have a range of tools, and they are all on the table. There are the standard tools, and we are refreshing the toolbox regarding tools that have not been tried here, or have not been used for a very long time.\\nAnd one more comment on monetary tools-in recent weeks the issue of the foreign exchange market has been in the headlines. Therefore, maybe this is the time to clarify-I did declare that in principle I would prefer that the exchange rate would be set by market equilibrium, and that was the also the Bank's approach before I took office. Practically, there is a window of exchange rates that we view as consistent with price stability and economic activity, when we take into account all the factors and variables in the economy. The window is dynamic, and depends on parameters that change all the time, which naturally should not be disclosed.\\nFrom this perspective, the Bank of Israel policy on this issue could be called \"constructive ambiguity\", which is the appropriate policy for a small economy such as Israel; and therefore, if and when the Bank of Israel will assess that the exchange rate has materially deviated from the window that we defined, we may very well intervene in the market-and no one will receive a warning letter from us beforehand.\\nThank you!"

        "title": "Mario Draghi: Farewell remarks",
        "content": "This year marks two decades of monetary union, which is by any measure a momentous anniversary. Not so long ago, the euro area economy was scarred by a level of unemployment probably unseen since the Great Depression, and fundamental questions were being asked about whether the euro would survive. Today 11 million more people are in work. Public trust in the euro has risen to its highest level ever. Across the euro area, policymakers are reaffirming that the euro is irreversible.\\nBut I see today more as an occasion to reflect than to celebrate.\\nThe euro is an eminently political project, a fundamental step towards the goal of greater political integration, which found its economic justification in the parlous state of European economies in the mid-1980s. Unemployment had risen from 2.6% in 1973 to 9.2% in 1985 and growth had slowed significantly in the 12 countries that would go on to form the euro area.\\nWhat the visionary leaders of that era saw, however, was that Europe had a powerful tool at its disposal to raise growth: to transform its common market into a single market. Removing existing barriers to trade and investment could reverse the decline in economic potential and bring more people back into work.\\nYet the Single Market was always about more than just this. It also aimed to protect people from some of the costs of the changes that would inevitably arise. Unlike the wider process of globalisation, it allowed Europe to impose its values on economic integration - to build a market that, to the extent possible, was free and just. Common rules would create trust between countries, give the weak recourse against the strong and provide safeguards for workers.\\nThe Single Market, in this sense, was a bold attempt at \"managed globalisation\". It combined competition with levels of consumer and social protection unseen in the rest of the world.\\nBut there was one type of unfair practice that the Single Market could not prohibit: competitive devaluations. That prospect would undermine the mutual trust that was critical for the Single Market to survive and for the project of greater political integration to progress.\\nFreely floating currencies were therefore not an option, and fixed exchange rates would not work as capital became more mobile within Europe, as the ERM crisis in 1992-3 proved.\\nThe answer was to create a single currency: one market with one money.\\nThis construct has been largely successful: incomes across the continent have materially increased, integration and value chains have developed to an extent unimaginable 20 years ago, and the Single Market has survived intact through the worst crisis since the 1930s.1\\nBut the past 20 years have taught us two vital lessons for a successful monetary union.\\nThe first concerns monetary policy.\\nWhen the ECB was established, its dominant concern was to keep inflation down. The ECB was a new central bank with no track record, so its policy framework was expressly designed to build strong anti-inflationary credibility. It achieved this quickly, and it is to the tremendous credit of the ECB's early leaders that its first decade went so smoothly.\\nBut no one could have foreseen that the environment facing monetary policy globally was soon to abruptly reverse: that inflationary forces would turn into deflationary ones.\\nIn all advanced economies, this called for a new paradigm for central banking, which comprised two elements: the determination to fight deflation as strongly as inflation, and flexibility in the choice of instruments to do so.\\nIn our case, the ECB has proven that it will not accept threats to monetary stability caused by unfounded fears about the future of the euro. It has shown that it will fight risks to price stability on the downside as vigorously as those on the upside. And it has established that it will use all the tools within its mandate to secure its mandate - without ever exceeding the limits of the law.\\nThe European Court of Justice has affirmed the legality of the measures we have taken, and it has confirmed the ECB's broad discretion in using all its instruments in a necessary and proportionate way to achieve its objective.\\nThis judgement was crucial, because at stake was the essence of the central bank that the ECB has become, and that most people in Europe want to see: a modern central bank able to deploy all its instruments commensurate with the challenges it faces, and a truly federal institution that acts in the interests of the whole euro area.2\\nThe second lesson concerns the institutional construction of EMU.\\nThe euro area is built on the principle of \"monetary dominance\", which requires monetary policy to be single-minded in its focus on price stability and never to be subordinate to fiscal policy. \"Monetary dominance\" does not preclude communicating with governments when it is clear that mutually aligned policies would deliver a faster return to price stability. It means that alignment between policies, where needed, must serve the objective of monetary stability and should not work to the detriment of it.3\\nToday, we are in a situation where low interest rates are not delivering the same degree of stimulus as in the past, because the rate of return on investment in the economy has fallen. Monetary policy can still achieve its objective, but it can do so faster and with fewer side effects if fiscal policies are aligned with it.\\nThis is why, since 2014, the ECB has gradually placed more emphasis on the macroeconomic policy mix in the euro area.4 A more active fiscal policy in the euro area would make it possible to adjust our policies more quickly and lead to higher interest rates.\\nIn our monetary union, national policies play the main role in fiscal stabilisation - much more so than state-level policies in the US. But national policies cannot always guarantee the right fiscal stance for the euro area as a whole. Coordinating decentralised fiscal policies is inherently complex. And uncoordinated policies are not enough, because the spillovers between countries from fiscal expansions are relatively low.\\nThis is why we need a euro area fiscal capacity of adequate size and design: large enough to stabilise the monetary union, but designed not to create excessive moral hazard.\\nThere will be no perfect solution. When risks are shared, moral hazard can never be reduced to zero, though it can be greatly contained by proper design. At the same time, we should also recognise that sharing risks can help reduce risks.\\nThe building of a capital markets union, which would lead to greater risk-sharing in the private sector, would considerably reduce the fraction of risks that need to be managed by a central fiscal capacity. And a central fiscal capacity would in turn reduce risks for the whole union when national policies are unable to play their role.\\nIn other regions where fiscal policy has played a greater role since the crisis, we have seen that the recovery began sooner and the return to price stability has been faster. The US had a deficit of 3.6% on average from 2009 to 2018, while the euro area had a surplus of 0.5%.5\\nIn other words, the US has had both a capital markets union and a counter-cyclical fiscal policy. The euro area had no capital markets union and a pro-cyclical fiscal policy.\\nThe road towards a fiscal capacity will most likely be a long one. History shows that budgets have rarely been created for the general purpose of stabilisation, but rather to deliver specific goals in the public interest. In the US, it was the need to overcome the Great Depression that led to the expansion of the federal budget in the 1930s. Perhaps, for Europe, it will require an urgent cause such as mitigating climate change to bring about such collective focus.\\nWhichever path is taken, it is plain to see that now is the time for more Europe, not less. I mean this not in an axiomatic way, but in the truest traditions of federalism. Where results can best be delivered by national policies, let it stay that way. But where we can only deliver on the legitimate concerns of the public by working together, we need Europe to be stronger.\\nFor us Europeans, in a globalised world, a true sovereignty that meets people's needs for security and prosperity can be achieved only by working together.6 As Chancellor Merkel has said, \"we Europeans have to take our destiny into our own hands if we want to survive as a community\".7\\nWorking together allows us to protect our interests in the world economy, to resist the pressures of foreign powers, to influence global rules to reflect our standards, and to enforce our values on global corporations. None of these can be achieved to the same degree by countries acting alone. In a globalised world, sharing sovereignty is a way to regain sovereignty.\\nBut recognising that we need to exercise what President Macron has termed \"European sovereignty\"8 to be effective does not mean that we already have the political infrastructures to do so today. Awareness of their necessity is growing quickly, however.\\nWe saw this emerging in the most recent European Parliament election, which was perhaps the first such election fought mainly on European questions. Even those who were seeking to slow down European integration did so by contesting the EU institutions rather than rejecting their legitimacy outright.\\nThis is only a start, but it suggests our union is moving in the right direction. I am confident that it will continue to do so, because it is ultimately the self-interest of individual countries that lays out our future path towards a European sovereign.\\nThe actions of many committed Europeans, at both the national and EU levels, have helped us to reach this point. There are three groups whose contributions I would like to single out.\\nThe first is the staff of the ECB and the national central banks.\\nThere were many occasions during the crisis where the ECB found itself in truly uncharted waters. We faced, by any measure, an incredibly complex economic situation, with new challenges appearing the moment old ones were resolved.\\nThose years were intense for you and your families. But your dedication, the success of the measures you designed, and the competence you displayed across the Eurosystem in implementing those measures, will make those years worth remembering.\\nThese policies are now available to all future policymakers to meet similar challenges. This is a legacy of which all Eurosystem staff can be proud. So, let me express my gratitude for all your remarkable efforts, which have truly served the ECB through this unprecedented time, and in doing so the people of Europe.\\nThe second group I would like to highlight are my colleagues on the Executive Board and Governing Council - both past and present. You have enacted a series of measures over the past eight years in extraordinary circumstances. The bedrock of those decisions has been your consistent and unconditional commitment to our mandate.\\nYou have been unwavering in your determination both to deliver our mandate and to stay within its confines - to never accept failure. You can look back with satisfaction on what you achieved in extremely testing conditions, and in the knowledge that you have improved the welfare of many people.\\nWhat unites the Governing Council has always been - and will always be - much greater than anything that might divide it. We all share the same devotion to our mandate and the same passion for Europe. I trust that this shared conviction will continue to serve the ECB and Europe in the years to come.\\nThe third group is Europe's leaders.\\nWe had to take measures that sometimes appeared controversial at first and whose benefits were only revealed slowly. Our determination never wavered as it was founded on the solid work of our staff, nourished by empathy for the people who were suffering, and strengthened by the conviction that the policies would improve their situation.\\nBut in such times - and especially in a multi-country currency union - political leaders who transcended national perspectives when assessing our monetary policy, and who acknowledged the euro area perspective and explained it to their domestic audience, provided an essential bulwark for our independence.\\nI am grateful that we have had such leaders in Europe, and for your steadfast support and encouragement throughout the crisis.\\nPresident Macron, President Mattarella, Chancellor Merkel: you have stood beside us unfailingly in the European Council and in global forums, at a time when other major central banks have faced increasingly vocal political pressure. You have pushed back strongly against illiberal voices that would see us turn our back on European integration.\\nAnd, at critical moments, you have taken the steps needed to safeguard the euro and protect the heritage that was left to us: a united, peaceful and prosperous Europe.\\nThe time has come for me to hand over to Christine Lagarde. I have every confidence that you will be a superb leader of the ECB.\\nMy goal has always been to comply with the mandate enshrined in the Treaty, pursued in total independence, and carried out through an institution that has developed into a modern central bank capable of managing any challenge.\\nIt has been a privilege and an honour to have the opportunity to do so.\\nThank you.\\n1 See speech by Mario Draghi entitled \"Europe and the euro 20 years on\" on accepting the Laurea Honoris Causa in economics from the University of Sant'Anna, Pisa, 15 December 2018.\\n2 See speech by Mario Draghi entitled \"Twenty Years of the ECB's monetary policy\" at the ECB Forum on Central Banking, Sintra, 18 June 2019.\\n3 Speech by Mario Draghi entitled \"Policymaking, responsibility and uncertainty\" on accepting the Laurea Honoris Causa from the Universit\\xe0 Cattolica, 11 October 2019.\\n4 See speech by Mario Draghi entitled \"Unemployment in the euro area\" at the Annual central bank symposium in Jackson Hole, 22 August 2014.\\n5 Average cyclically adjusted primary balance as a percentage of potential GDP.\\n6 See speech by Mario Draghi entitled \"Sovereignty in a globalised world\", on accepting the Laurea Honoris Causa in law from Universit\\xe0 degli Studi di Bologna, Bologna, 22 February 2019.\\n7 Speech by Chancellor Angela Merkel to the European Parliament, Strasbourg, 13 November 2018.\\n8 Speech by President Emmanuel Macron to the European Parliament, Strasbourg, 17 April 2018."

This will be my fourth time at this unmissable annual event, but the first for you, Florence. Bernard Delas and I would like to offer you our warmest wishes for success at the head of the F\\xe9d\\xe9ration fran\\xe7aise de l'assurance (FFA - French insurance federation). For our part, changes are also underway and I would like to take the opportunity this evening to welcome the appointment of Dominique Laboureix as Secretary General of the ACPR, with First Deputy Secretary General, Patrick Montagner, whom you know well, at his side.\\nThe subject of your 11th Conference - \"Insuring in the long term in a short-term world\" - perfectly sums up the real challenge to the insurance profession. I would like to begin by thanking France's 712 authorised insurers that never waver in playing their key role in the financing of our economy, with EUR 2,600 billion of investments. In 2018, France became the leading European insurance market, outpacing the United Kingdom and Germany in terms of total balance sheet value and non-life premiums earned. The French insurance market has also enjoyed strong growth, with revenue up by almost 3% [2.7% and 3.1% in non-life and life insurance, respectively]. In response to the legitimate concerns that many of you have raised, I have chosen to focus on two main issues: the challenge of low interest rates (I) and our ambition for the Solvency II review (II)."

        "content": "Central bankers have become increasingly prominent figures. Would it be preferable for them to go back to being rather low key?\\nMonetary policy has been overly prominent because other policy areas have not taken action. That's not good.\\nMario Draghi's term as ECB President is about to end. How will he be remembered?\\nHis mandate was marked by the debt crisis, three country bailouts, the extreme situations in Spain and Italy, and the real prospect of Greece being forced to leave the euro area. With one sentence he made it patently clear that he would preserve the single currency, thus marking the beginning of the recovery from 2013 onwards. The second standout moment is large-scale asset purchases. Despite the challenges of ECB decision-making, he built a consensus for implementing a policy that at the time was strictly necessary. In so doing, he modernised the ECB's toolkit, bringing the institution into line with the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England.\\nHis latest measures have been heavily criticised. Draghi himself has acknowledged that the side effects are increasing. Isn't it a contradiction to say that the ECB has room to act while, at the same time, warning of the adverse effects of its policies?\\nYou have to find the right balance. We try to take action and do our part, but the side effects are becoming increasingly clear over time. Central bankers are not almighty. We cannot fix problems such as trade wars or Brexit. Fiscal policy, structural reforms and the banking union have their part to play. If they don't, the side effects will be larger. And that's what we want to avoid.\\nAre the fiscal plans announced by governments, for example in Germany and the Netherlands, sufficient?\\nThe patchwork of fiscal policies - national policies and the Stability and Growth Pact - is not sufficient to deal with a severe downturn. The existing framework offers very little scope for complementing monetary policy. That is why I am convinced of the need for a centralised and independent fiscal instrument. It would also provide support to national fiscal policies.\\nThe ECB has not met its inflation objective since 2013. Has it failed to fulfil its price stability mandate?\\nLet's not forget that the risk of deflation was averted, and that risk was extremely dangerous. Inflation has indeed been below the objective for some time, but behind this there are structural changes for which we don't yet have a full explanation.\\nIs this damaging the institution's credibility?\\nNo. We would have had a credibility problem if deflation had taken hold. The question is why wage increases are not passing through to price inflation. This is one of the legacies of the crisis a decade ago.\\nWhat is Christine Lagarde's biggest challenge?\\nOn the one hand, the severity of the economic slowdown. We expect growth to be slightly above 1%, but with downside risks. In the financial sector, the greatest challenges are banks' very low profitability, risks stemming from low rates and the assets managed by the funds industry, which have grown considerably.\\nThe ECB's policies have had the undesired effect of redistributing income.\\nThey have had a certain negative effect on savers and have potentially pushed up asset prices, but they have also had a positive effect in the form of economic growth, job creation and wage increases. According to our calculations, the net effect has added 2 percentage points to growth. As a result of the ECB's actions, the situation in Europe is nothing like it was ten years ago.\\nThere has been criticism of the ECB becoming more political and less technical with Christine Lagarde and you at the helm - both of you are former ministers with no central banking experience.\\nMonetary policy must be just another element that has a place within economic policy. It's good to have experience in other areas. Central bankers have sometimes been working in an ivory tower. Christine Lagarde - not to mention myself -is well versed in the euro area's mechanisms. The ECB's decision-makers need to understand the context, make sound choices from among the alternatives and communicate appropriately. Ms Lagarde will do this extremely clearly.\\nInternal criticism, resignations, partisan leaks to the press- Divisions within the ECB seem to have flared up in recent weeks.\\nStrangely, there's sometimes more politics going on inside a central bank than in governments. Seriously though, the 25 members of the Governing Council should try to build a consensus. And when a decision is made, it must be embraced.\\nThat isn't happening right now. Are these fights damaging the ECB?\\nI wouldn't say they are damaging it, but certainly they are not contributing to the effectiveness of the policies.\\nCriticism of Draghi is intensifying in the north of Europe. Are you fearful of disengagement from the European project in countries such as Germany?\\nWe have to redouble our communication efforts. The ECB has delivered low inflation and a favourable environment in which Germany has enjoyed ten years of strong growth. Germany has been much better off with the euro.\\nIn September the votes against came from countries that together account for more than half of the eurozone's population.\\nI don't represent Spain on the Executive Board. You have to act with the entire eurozone in mind. The \"one member, one vote\" system, as occurs in the Governing Council, is especially democratic as it avoids imbalances in the decision-making process. But we clearly have to consider Germany. If the German economy grinds to a halt, we will all be affected. We're all in the same boat.\\nCould Ms Lagarde's arrival ease some of these tensions?\\nI don't think there will be a sudden change in policy by any means. I'm confident that everyone on the Governing Council will work together with Christine Lagarde with unwavering loyalty from the outset.\\nThe ECB has just lowered its growth forecasts, but some people think they are still too optimistic.\\nThe slowdown is coming from the external sector, which has a strong impact on countries like Germany. If it does fall into recession, it will be a technical recession and the economy will rebound quickly. The risk is not so much one of recession, but rather of entering a prolonged period of very moderate growth, below 1.5%. This is why players other than the ECB have to get involved.\\nIs the euro area prepared for a no-deal Brexit?\\nThe financial sector is, yes. But the main impact will not come from the financial sector; it will come from the overall impact on the United Kingdom, which is the second-largest European economy. Contingency plans are in place in the financial sector, but other sectors are not as well prepared.\\nThe Spanish economy is also starting to be a concern.\\nSpain has enjoyed above-average growth since 2013, but nobody can escape the global slowdown. That said, the Spanish economy can steer clear of a recession if mistakes are avoided, because it is much better prepared than in the past. It is more competitive, its banking sector is healthier and levels of private debt are lower.\\nAnd government debt of close to 100% of GDP Did we waste the opportunity to bring it down more quickly in the good years?\\nConsiderable efforts have been made. Spain's deficit had reached 11% of GDP, but this year it will be around 2%. It's always the case that more could have been done, but equally less could have been done.\\nTo what extent is the current political deadlock weighing on the economy?\\nI won't comment on countries' internal political issues. All I can say is that I was an acting minister for almost a year, and it's not a nice situation to be in. A cyclical slowdown is coming, but certainly not a crisis like we saw in 2008."

        "title": "Jens Weidmann: Climate change and central banks",
        "content": "1 Welcome\\nLadies and gentlemen,\\nAllow me to bid you a warm welcome to the Deutsche Bundesbank's second financial market conference, on my own behalf and that of Sabine Mauderer, here at the Gesellschaftshaus in Frankfurt's green haven, the Palmengarten.\\nFrankfurt's most charming park, the Palmengarten was created 150 years ago, and a series of events have been scheduled this week to commemorate this anniversary. When Adolphe, Duke of Nassau, was forced to disband his collection of exotic plants housed in Schloss Biebrich in 1866, Heinrich Siesmayer, a Frankfurt garden designer, came up with a clever idea - he set up a stock corporation to buy the plants and build a botanical garden in Frankfurt. City folk snapped up the shares in this company, allowing Siesmayer to buy Duke Adolphe's green treasures for a price of 60,000 Gulden.1 I suppose you could say that the foundation of Frankfurt's Palmengarten was an early example of \"green finance\", given that it was a privately funded green investment.\\nBut there is more to green finance than that, of course. It is a term that also includes accounting for climate risks in the financial sector, or the transition to a greener financial system. If environmental concerns are joined by economic and social sustainability considerations, it is common to use the term \"sustainable finance\".2 And that is what today's conference is all about: sustainable finance. Judging by the huge turnout, I dare say we've really got our finger on the pulse.\\nWe want this conference to be a forum for dialogue among representatives from the financial industry, academia and the public sector. Government is hugely interested in growing a sustainable financial sector, as you can see from the fact that not one, not two, but three finance ministers are in attendance. And incidentally, the Palmengarten was more than just a private initiative - the city of Frankfurt provided the land needed to build it.\\n2 Climate risks and central banks\\n2.1 Financial stability\\nLadies and gentlemen,\\nThe need to transition to a low-carbon economy has become a very important topic, not just from financial market perspective, but also from the vantage point of central banks. And that is what I would like to discuss in a little more detail over the next few minutes.\\nWhen my colleague Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, delivered his widely-regarded Lloyd's of London speech just four years ago, climate risk was still languishing as a marginal issue for most central banks.3 Climate awareness has changed dramatically since then: central banks, supervisory and regulatory authorities have come to recognise that climate risks also impact on their core tasks.\\nMark Carney built his speech around the implications of climate change for financial stability, giving it the title \"Breaking the tragedy of the horizon\" in a reference to tragedy of the commons.4 If a field or any other common (that is, shared) resource is used without constraint, individual users' rational desire to maximise their yield can end up destroying that resource through overuse. Economists call these situations \"externalities\" - that is, impacts on others which the agents had failed to account for - and thus explain the tragedy of why humanity finds it so hard to give the environment, as a common resource, the effective protection it needs.\\nWhen the market fails in this way, it is up to government to take corrective action. The English economist Arthur Pigou suggested imposing a tax. The alternative idea of emission trading was inspired by his compatriot Ronald Coase. What both theories have in common is the idea of putting a price tag on the external costs of our behaviour and creating incentives to change how we act.\\nUp until now, not enough attention has been given to the costs of environmentally harmful behaviour - as a result, the implications and risks associated with climate change and climate policy have not been fully priced into financial assets.\\nMark Carney stressed recently that the global financial system is currently funding a 4\\xb0C rise in the temperature of the planet - double the pledge to limit increases to well below 2\\xb0C contained in the Paris Agreement.5 To stand a good chance of meeting the 2\\xb0C target agreed in Paris, annual emissions can be no more than 1,100 gigatonnes of CO2. And to achieve the more ambitious 1.5\\xb0C target, that figure would be less than 400 gigatonnes.6\\nThat would mean never using a large share of fossil fuel reserves, because that would deplete the remaining carbon budget many times over. And that, in turn, will result in carbon-intensive investments losing value. The massive and abrupt materialisation of such losses might have implications for financial stability.7\\nThe role of financial supervisors is to gauge the significance of climate-related risks for the financial system - and not just the risks caused by transitioning to a low-carbon economy, but also the ones triggered by climate change itself - such as the damage caused by an accumulation of extreme weather events.\\nThat is why it is so important for climate risks to be disclosed and anchored in supervisory practice. Supervisors are hard at work at the methodically challenging task of carrying out any climate stress tests that may be required.\\nBanks are required to also take climate risks into account. Our latest survey among small and medium-sized banks found that it is still early days for institutions looking to manage climate risks in practice: one-third of them said that climate risks feature, at least to a certain degree, in their risk management, while two-thirds said that they have not (yet) begun to do so.8\\nModelling climate risks accurately is crucial for proper risk management at banks. It could also have the side effect of making it less attractive to fund environmentally harmful investment. That said, it would be wrong to want to use banking regulations to set climate policy incentives, for example by granting risk weighting \"discounts\" for \"green\" assets.9 Capital requirements should always be geared to risk. Creating incentives to protect the climate, on the other hand, is a matter for politicians.\\n2.2 Monetary policy\\nThe importance of climate change and climate policy for central banks is not confined to our role as financial supervisors and guardians of financial stability, though. There can be all manner of monetary policy implications, too.10 Both climate change and climate policy can have a bearing on macroeconomic indicators such as output and inflation. Central banks need to learn how the transmission channels work. We are still at the beginning of this particular journey.\\nClimate change is particularly apparent over the course of the economic cycle when it takes the form of supply shocks - just take the price increases due to crop failures or low water levels. Monetary policymakers normally look through such temporary disruptions. But climate change could well make these shocks stronger and more frequent in the future.11 This can make growth rates, inflation figures or financial market prices more volatile.\\nWhat is more, climate change might be accompanied by long-term structural shifts - such as changes in potential growth or the natural rate of interest - and could well be of relevance to monetary policymakers. The same can be said for climate policy tools such as a carbon tax or emissions trading which, depending on their configuration, will probably impact noticeably on economic and price developments.\\nIn a nutshell, gauging the prospects and risks for price stability could become even more of a challenge going forward. On top of this, there are some who are calling for monetary policymakers to take specific action to combat climate change.12 However, I am very critical when people say that monetary policymakers need to \"go green\" by launching \"green QE\", say, or granting specific privileges to green assets within the collateral framework.\\nHow hard should government, business and society push back against climate change? What measures need to be taken, and what behaviour should be encouraged or punished? These are political questions for elected governments and parliaments to answer. They are decisions which are not for central banks to take, because they lack the requisite democratic legitimacy.\\nOur mandate is to preserve price stability, and policy implementation needs to be in line with principle of market neutrality. Skewing asset purchases to green bonds, say, would run counter to this principle, which is anchored in Article 127 of the EU Treaty.\\nAnd a trade-off could arise once monetary policy considerations call for applying the brakes and scaling back the bond purchases. In this situation, I dare say there would be calls to press ahead with the green asset purchase programme. After all, it is not immediately apparent why efforts to combat climate change should only be made when price pressures are weak.\\nHowever, asset purchases need to be reserved for exceptional situations under the Eurosystem's monetary policy framework and under no circumstances be deployed indefinitely. That would also render a further question redundant - the matter of whether the asset purchase programme in its existing form favours carbon-intensive enterprises and thus cements the existing structures.13\\nA monetary policy which pursues explicitly environmental policy objectives is at risk of being overburdened. And in the long run, the central bank's independence might be called into question. What matters to me is that we do not generally promote sustainability using instruments which serve other purposes. I think a decisive and effective climate policy is the right course of action - but it needs to be implemented using the right instruments and by agents which have the democratic legitimacy needed for that purpose.\\n2.3 NGFS and portfolio management\\nThat certainly does not mean that we at the Bundesbank do not also have scope, within the constraints of our mandate, to help green the financial system.\\nWe are an active player in national and global bodies dedicated to forging a more sustainable financial system. Sabine Mauderer will use her speech later today to discuss our involvement in the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS).\\nFurthermore, as a fiscal agent, we manage a host of public sector pension portfolios and have already helped multiple clients gear their investment policy to sustainability criteria.\\n3 Conclusion\\nLadies and gentlemen,\\nCentral banks will play a part in transitioning to a low-carbon economy. We can help make the financial system more sustainable yet must never lose sight of our core mandate.\\nGreen finance can augment effective and smart climate policy, but it cannot replace it. It is, and always will be, a matter for democratically elected politicians to make the necessary transition a reality and to break the tragedy of the horizon.\\nIn closing, ladies and gentlemen, may I wish you a day rich with insightful and rewarding dialogue here at the Palmengarten, Frankfurt's green haven.\\nThank you for your attention.\\n1 B.

Klaas Knot was asked to deliver a short opening statement. In it, Mr Knot focussed on the challenges the Economic and Monetary Union faces over the medium term, concluding with three concrete recommendations.\\n***\\nI would like to start by thanking the organizers of the Group of Thirty for the chance to participate in this panel. In my introduction, I will focus on the challenges the Economic and Monetary Union faces over the medium term.\\nLet me start by saying that the concept of the 'medium term' is an intriguing one. From a political perspective the medium term is a place where one kicks the proverbial can to. From a monetary policy perspective, on the other hand, problems in the medium term would typically be cause for immediate action. This asymmetry in policy reactions might be at the core of the institutional frictions facing the Economic and Monetary Union since the global financial crisis.\\nThe twenty years since the formation of the Economic and Monetary Union can be divided into two very different periods. The first decade was characterized by stable inflation and economic growth."

        "content": "INTRODUCTION\\nLadies and gentlemen,\\nI, too, would like to warmly welcome you to what is the Bundesbank's second financial market conference, and the first dedicated to the subject of sustainability.\\nIt's great to see such a huge turnout! There are 540 of us here today - if that's not a sign that we're really concerned about sustainability, I don't know what is. And I am also pleased that Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann and our panellists have just underscored the significance of climate protection and sustainable finance.\\nThe heading of our conference today asks whether sustainable finance is a game changer for our financial system. A game changer is something that disrupts everything - the way we think, and the way we act. Sustainability is just such a game changer.\\nWe need to make sustainability a key principle so that we can preserve the foundations of how we live and do business.\\nClimate change makes a particularly urgent case for this. The United in Science report1 for the most recent UN Climate Action Summit writes that the average global temperature for 2015-2019 is on track to be the warmest of any equivalent period on record. The authors also observe that climate change is putting pressure on the environment's ability to support and supply food, water, health and wellbeing, and note its potentially threatening consequences for the economy, security and civil unrest.\\nThe challenge has staggering dimensions.  In order to bring global economic growth into line with the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement, the OECD, the World Bank and the UN estimate that infrastructure investment alone would be needed to the tune of US$6.9 trillion.  That's the figure each year, up to 2030.\\nAt present, there is no telling what share of this will be taken on by private players in the financial market and how much will be shouldered by the public sector.\\nBut it's not only a matter of who pays what. It's just as much about getting clear answers to the questions:\\nWho plays what role?\\nWho needs to decide what, and what action is required?\\nPolitics, finance and the real economy, and central banks, too - they each have different tasks. Protecting the climate calls for a clear allocation of roles. Many different agents need to pull together as a team - and pull in the same direction as well.\\nLet's begin with the central banks.\\nA. CENTRAL BANKS\\nI joined the Bundesbank's Executive Board just over a year ago, and during this time, I've been to many green finance meetings where the remark was made:\\n\"Just leave it to the central banks to save the climate as well!\". That demand sounds alluring - after all, if a single institution could take on this whole issue, wouldn't that make things so much more straightforward?\\nWhy do some people think that this task would be child's play for central banks? Central banks have been thrust into a starring role once before - in resolving the recent crises. You won't be surprised to learn that the Bundesbank's response to this was reserved. The impression emerged at that time that central banks were the \"last man standing\", and also that they had very deep pockets. We operated as a crisis manager.\\nSo if central banks already have a track record in managing financial crises, why can't those seemingly mighty institutions manage a climate crisis, too?\\nThere's no shortage of advice when it comes to regulatory and monetary policy matters:\\ngive privileged treatment to green financial instruments - for example, by requiring less capital backing for green loans or securities,\\nfavour green collateral in monetary policy credit operations,\\nor even green asset purchase programmes, ranging from green QE to ultimately financing public investment to promote the transition to a low-carbon economy.\\nLet me be clear about this:\\nClimate risks are a source of considerable financial risks, which is why climate change is a hugely important topic for central banks.  This can be said for financial stability, banking supervision, financial markets and, in some respects, for monetary policy, too.\\nBut central banks are ill-suited for the task of crisis manager for the climate. The ground rules which keep the economy's and society's footprint on the environment in check are set by politicians. They have the democratic legitimacy to do so - central banks don't. That is also the reason why we, as central banks, are not permitted to conduct economic or environmental policy, even if forward-looking decisions are urgently needed on these fronts.\\nHowever, central banks will do everything they can and must do, within the scope of their mandate, to protect the climate.\\nCentral banks around the world have long since recognised their importance in matters of climate protection. This is why eight central banks and banking supervisors got together at the end of 2017 to establish a global network. The Bundesbank was a founding member of this Network for Greening the Financial System, or NGFS for short. It today boasts 46 central banks and supervisors as well as nine observers, including the IMF, the BIS and others.\\nOur aim is to act in an internationally consistent manner and pool our expertise. Only thus can we mount a global response to this new challenging financial risk. We are focusing on how we can mitigate the financial risks stemming from climate change, particularly in the monitoring of financial stability and in banking supervision. On top of that, we are also looking at how sustainable finance can be given a more prominent role - including in central bank portfolios.\\nI myself presented an NGFS investment guide on sustainable portfolio management at central banks on the margins of the last annual meeting of the IMF and the World Bank. This handbook also contains the results of a survey among the NGFS member central banks. One finding is that a growing number of these central banks also take sustainability factors into account in their portfolio management. To be more precise, 25 of the 27 central banks surveyed are already investing sustainably or planning to do so. The survey also reveals that, alongside reputational risk, risk-return considerations are among the key drivers here.\\nCentral banks can pave the way for more sustainability. Particularly with portfolios that are not geared towards monetary policy, but also as fiscal agents. At the Bundesbank, we are currently reviewing how sustainable our euro-denominated own funds portfolio already is and where there is still room for improvement.\\nRight now, this portfolio is worth around \\u20ac12 billion and is invested exclusively in fixed-interest covered bonds denominated in euro. Besides this, in its role as a fiscal agent, the Bundesbank holds portfolios for external public sector clients such as central government and a number of federal state governments, which involves managing amounts in the high two-digit billions. Four of the 16 portfolios already follow an ESG approach2 or are invested in green bonds. So all in all, we're talking about a figure in the high single-digit billions. What's more, four federal states - Hesse, Baden-W\\xfcrttemberg, North Rhine-Westphalia and Brandenburg - have recently followed Berlin's lead and commissioned tailored sustainability indices as a benchmark. This involves assessing enterprises according to ESG criteria; the Bundesbank can apply the resulting benchmark to the portfolios of the federal states.\\nThe public sector is therefore leading by example. This is crucial to the acceptance of sustainable finance in Germany.\\nAs guardians of financial stability and as banking supervisors, we central banks see climate change as a source of financial risk. We need to get to grips with the effects of climate change on the stability of individual institutions and on the stability of the financial system overall. That's why central banks are calling for greater market transparency and better data availability.\\nWho is affected by climate risks and how - via loans to certain industrial sectors, for instance? These are some of the important issues that the Bundesbank will also be tackling in this year's Financial Stability Review.\\nFinancial institutions need to pay proper attention to climate risks in their risk management. In terms of financial supervision, key factors therefore include better risk models at individual institutions and better awareness of how climate risks are distributed within the financial system. Financial supervisors will need sophisticated methods to identify the vulnerabilities caused by climate risk more clearly. A \"climate stress test\" should form part of our toolkit. But before this can happen, we need the right data and a better understanding of the basic issues.\\nWe need to apply a longer time horizon to our entire analytical framework if we are also to factor in longer-term climate effects.\\nSo our intended course of action is not simple, but it is effective - and we are not alone. Two weeks ago, I was in Washington, D.C., where I took part in a panel discussion with Kristalina Georgieva, the new head of the IMF, who emphasised that the IMF is losing no time in preparing to incorporate climate risk into its country analyses.3\\nB.  POLICY\\nThe IMF is a sort of interface between central banks and policymakers. This brings me to the most important of the parties involved when it comes to creating a framework for the transformation we need: political stakeholders.\\nThe framework established by policymakers needs to be environmentally and economically effective. It must offer planning certainty to the real economy and the financial markets alike. The key is to keep the costs of transitioning to a low-carbon economy as low as possible for the economy and to distribute these costs efficiently and, at the same time, fairly among society.\\nThe German government's climate package is a good start. But it's clear that further steps will also be needed. The cornerstone of this climate package is a more comprehensive CO2 pricing system. This approach has been endorsed by numerous experts. It will probably need to be readjusted as time goes by; a fact we are fully aware of. What this will boil down to is a balancing act between comfortably meeting climate goals and clear prospects for economic agents.\\nWhat do we need from political stakeholders in terms of the financial markets?\\nThe answer is: solid guidelines for sustainable finance reforms, ideally at the international level. Financial regulation isn't a climate policy instrument; instead, it serves to safeguard the stability of the financial system. What's crucial here is the focus on financial risk rather than on promoting economic growth. And that mustn't change.\\nBaFin recently published a notice providing supervisory guidance to institutions on dealing with the increasingly important issue of sustainability risks. In other areas, the EU is taking action with its sustainable finance action plan - in the form of its new taxonomy that defines which economic activities are considered \"green\", for instance. The European Council hopes that the taxonomy will be fully implemented by the end of 2022.\\nDisclosure standards for increased transparency are just as important. Who is exposed to what climate risks? The recommendations issued by the G20 Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures are aimed at establishing consistency in climate-related reporting. A great deal is riding on these recommendations, since financial markets can only distribute capital efficiently with regard to climate risk and perform its guiding role properly if transparent, price-relevant information is available.\\nNor must we underestimate the growing importance of sustainable finance within the EU as a location factor. The Federal Government has recognised this and wishes Germany to play a leading role as a hub for sustainable finance. The Sustainable Finance Advisory Council is to act as coordinator here, providing the government with strategic advice and specific recommendations for action. The Council has already outlined the first topics it believes should now be tackled in more detail. The first progress report should be ready as early as the start of 2020, in view of Germany's EU presidency in the second half of next year, amongst other factors. What's crucial here is that the government will receive specific, workable recommendations within the next year.\\nHowever, policymakers themselves can lead by example when it comes to sustainable finance. And that's exactly what they are doing. Central government and several federal state governments have decided to invest their pension portfolios according to sustainable criteria.\\nC. FINANCIAL SECTOR\\nThis brings me to the financial sector itself. Here, too, we have been seeing attempts to adjust to climate change for a long while: by the banking industry, insurers and funds. A huge amount of capital needs to be mobilised for the transition to a climate-friendly economy - public capital, but even more private capital. In future, this will also mean that sustainable financial products will grow more important in the investment advice given to retail investors - which is what the EU wants.\\nAt the same time, financial institutions have to comply with regulatory ratios concerning liquidity and solvency, for example. That's not always an easy task. Nonetheless, the past few years have seen a lot of movement in sustainable and, in particular, green forms of financing, both at financial institutions and in the financial markets.\\nFinancial institutions and financial markets play a central role in the effective and efficient allocation of capital in the real economy.\\nFinancial institutions and financial markets help decide which projects are financed - and which ones are not. We need to leverage this steering effect and thus support the necessary structural change - the transformation of the real economy.\\nHere, financial markets have two special features:\\nFirst, financial markets respond faster to new information than the real economy can.\\nSecond, the financial system is a global network - this means that climate risks do not remain confined to local or regional areas: they can travel.\\nFor their own risk management, financial institutions have to constantly ask themselves anew: which risks are looming where in the balance sheets? How high is the danger of those risks materialising? With climate risk, it is vital to extend the observation horizon. The search for yield is sometimes focused on the short term. Climate risk, on the other hand, is of a more medium to long-term nature. It has to form part of the analysis - chiefly because some of the consequences of climate changes are irreversible.\\nBut besides risks, there are also opportunities for the financial sector. By allocating capital in a smart way, the financial sector can generate returns and at the same time act as a driver of innovation and growth in the fight to mitigate climate change.\\nThe UN has recognised this potential and brought together a group of the world's largest pension funds and insurers.4 The group is called the \"Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance\", and is responsible for investments worth more than US$2.4 trillion. The institutions within the group have committed to transitioning to carbon-neutral investment portfolios by 2050.\\nIn the financial market, demand for green investments has so far well outstripped supply. No doubt many of you can attest to this - it really isn't that easy to invest sustainably. But when market mechanisms function properly, the imbalance between supply and demand is gradually redressed.\\nStill, the market for green bonds has considerable growth potential.\\nIn 2007, the European Investment Bank laid the foundation for the green bond market segment when it issued its first Climate Awareness Bond.\\nSince then, green bonds have become more attractive and accepted, primarily for investors interested in sustainability. Europe is aiming to become a leader in sustainable finance. However, outstanding green bonds only account for just under 2% of the international bond market as a whole, despite appreciable growth rates.5\\nFurther market growth will have a positive effect as long as it is \"healthy\". In other words, the market cannot simply be greenwashed with green labels. What's \"green\" on the outside is \"green\" on the inside, too. Clear rules and regulations and reliable frameworks for green investment are therefore crucial, and that's a task for policymakers.\\nBut financial market participants themselves are also called upon to ensure we have reliable market indices and market standards.\\nMuch has already been achieved in both areas. Market standards such as the Green Bond Principles already provide guidance for issuers, but also for investors. The EU's new Green Bond Standard aims to build on these market practices and on the taxonomy, and promote market integrity. Rating agencies are integrating ESG information into their ratings and other scores. This is another building block to better price and track climate risk in the financial system and the real economy.\\nAnother driver of growth in sustainable bonds would be a positive risk/return profile compared with conventional bonds. The October 2019 issue of our Bundesbank Monthly Report compares secondary market trading in conventional and green bonds issued by the KfW and the EIB. According to the report, there are no clear patterns, at least when it comes to yield spreads. But the analysis is merely a snapshot.\\nOf course, it's not enough to look at the bond market alone; we also have to consider the equity market. A study of the equity market shows that investing in sustainable enterprises can be financially attractive for investors and, at the very least, does not have to put them at a disadvantage. The October issue of the Monthly Report comes to this conclusion based on a comparison between the very broad MSCI World stock index and its sustainable sub-index MSCI World ESG Leaders over the past ten years.\\nD. ECONOMY\\nLadies and gentlemen,\\nafter central banks, policymakers and the financial sector, there is one player left to discuss. It is the most important player, and represents the crux of the transformation: the real economy.\\nThe real economy should set its sights firmly on innovation.\\nClimate change poses financial risks to businesses, too, not just the financial sector. The faster enterprises transform, the better their ability to combat those risks. It is important for each individual sector of the economy to ask itself whether the transition is proceeding rapidly enough: that means industry and the services sector, and the agriculture and forestry sectors alike. Many enterprises have noticed that new products and services that make sparing use of natural resources are good for business. These products and services should touch on all areas of life, making the adjustment easier for households as well.\\nTo achieve the necessary transformation, we need to reach out to all corporate sectors - not just those that have already \"gone green\". This will enable us to minimise the risks involved in moving to a low-carbon economy. The production sector, in particular, is taking important steps to run more climate-friendly operations.\\nGlobal competition to come up with the best ideas, the most viable innovations for the future, is already bearing fruit - including in Germany.\\nThe automotive industry, which is so important to Germany, is one example of a sector that is responding late, but hopefully not too late, to the changes brought about by climate change. Without the automotive industry, a transition in forms of mobility would be unthinkable.Engineers are busy working on various alternative engine types.\\nOpenness to new technologies is the watchword, not just when it comes to types of engine in the automotive industry. We cannot let ourselves become fixated on one path and one path only - many roads lead to more sustainability.\\nAttitudes are clearly changing in many industries. Take, for example, the development of synthetic fuels for aviation and maritime transport, say, or measures to use waste heat and air in the cement industry, or ways of storing greenhouse gases underground, otherwise known as \"carbon capture and storage\". What I'm saying is that some of the innovative products and processes to better mitigate climate change already exist.\\nCONCLUSION\\nLadies and gentlemen,\\nI'd like to end on this positive note and return to the questions I posed at the beginning:\\nWho plays what role in mitigating climate change?\\nWho needs to decide what, and what action is required?\\nPolicymakers set the legal framework for business and society to act in a climate-friendly way. The financial system takes a risk-aware approach to directing financial flows into a sustainable economy. Central banks' climate focus is mainly on financial stability, but also on banking supervision, the financial markets as well as, to an extent, the impact on monetary policy.\\nBut it will be crucial for the real economy to transform, particularly the production sector. For this to happen, though, ultimately consumers have to change their consumption patterns and demand environmentally friendly products and services.\\nEvery one of us bears responsibility.\\nThe appetite for change exists. All we need to do now is act with determination. Let me end today's speech with another Goethe quote, then:\\n\"Enough words have been exchanged; now at last let me see some deeds!\"\\nThank you for your attention.\\n1 https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2019/09/unite-in-science-report/\\n2 ESG stands for environmental, social and governance.\\n3 \"The IMF is gearing up very rapidly to integrate climate risks in our surveillance work.\"\\n4 https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/assets/pdf/CAS_main_release.pdf\\n5 See Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report, October 2019."

        "content": "Your Excellency Gerberich, dear Mr. Janmaat, Secretary Vu\\u010di\\u0107, representatives of the central banks of Germany and Croatia, ladies and gentlemen,\\nIt is my great pleasure to address you at today's event to mark the launch of a particularly important project that we expect to contribute to our further profiling as a modern central bank, with strong capacity and readiness to join the European family of central banks.\\nThe European Union has been important institutional, economic and political benchmark for us from the outset of the transition process. The EU pre-accession process itself provides key tools that support and reinforce the reform process in a country aspiring to full membership, thereby strengthening its institutional capacity and economic foundations. Faster institutional and economic convergence, including faster convergence to the European central bank values, will also mean faster integration into the European family.\\nThat is why we, at the National Bank, have been strengthening our capacity through various modalities, often with direct EU support using the available tools. Active use of TAEX programs and direct bilateral cooperation with EU central banks are just some of the modalities used to strengthen our infrastructure in various operating segments. In this light, I think it is worth recalling the 2012 IPA project whose primary purpose was a detailed screening of our compliance with the European legislation and practices and a clear identification of gaps. I am pleased that today, thanks to the commitment of my colleagues, many of the gaps identified during the project have already been filled. In today's dynamic environment, however, where European legislation is undergoing major changes, harmonization with European standards is an ongoing process that implies permanent strengthening of the institutions' capacities.\\nOn behalf of the National Bank, I sincerely thank the EU for standing behind us and our efforts for further alignment of the rules, policies and operations with the European standards, with a view to further strengthening macroeconomic and financial stability. By supporting this project, we have been given confidence that we will undoubtedly justify by delivering concrete results. Project activities encompass four central banking areas. And it is particularly important that in the aftermath of the global economic crisis, these areas underwent major changes globally which pose new challenges for central banks.\\nThe first component includes payment services and payment systems - an area where the frequency of financial innovations is the greatest, which makes the challenges extremely high. The activities will be largely focused on drafting of the new law and the new bylaws on payment services and payment systems - in cooperation with the Ministry of Finance. The new regulation will entail transposing the latest European legislation in this area and setting grounds for significant changes to our payment landscape. Opening the door to fintech companies will provide opportunities to strengthen competition in the payment services market, and thus to enrich the offer of new, innovative and easily accessible products at a competitive price.\\nReflecting on the scope of this project, we have had in mind that, inter alia, the recent global economic crisis has clearly demonstrated that macroeconomic stability does not necessarily ensure financial stability. It acknowledged though that financial instability has long-term adverse effects on economic growth and macroeconomic stability. This explains the large step taken by the EU - a banking union set up on two pillars: the single supervisory mechanism and the single resolution mechanism. Undeniably, countries heading towards the EU and the European Monetary Union will have to work hard to harmonize the supervisory setup as well as other institutional and structural elements relevant for the smooth financial sector functioning.\\nTherefore, the second component addresses the banking regulation and supervision and aims to improve our supervisory capacities. Upon significant alignment with the European capital requirements, the focus will now be on the process of managing liquidity, but also on strengthening risk management in general, especially credit risk, which given the structure of banking activities is the most significant risk in the banking book. Project activities are in line with the latest Joint Conclusions of the economic and financial dialogue with the EU and among other things are aimed to further reduce non-performing loans, i.e. improve the quality of banks' balance sheets, which is important prerequisite for stronger credit support.    \\nI am pleased that this project validates our strategic goal of providing quality statistical data, fully compliant with international and European statistical standards. Specifically, the third project component focuses on the further development of financial account statistics, which is key to identifying cross-sectoral linkages within an economy and thereby identifying any possibility of spillover of shocks from one sector into another. Recently, we have taken a number of activities in this segment. Almost two years ago, we made our first data transfer of the annual accounts - stock to Eurostat, and in April last year, we prepared detailed data on the flow of assets and liabilities for the government sector, which is one of the key components in compiling spreadsheets for the excessive deficit procedure (EDP). The project activities will be aimed to further improving of the quality of this statistics, especially given that its first release is scheduled for next year.\\nFor us at the National Bank, the achievement in the fourth component - research, knowledge and skills in policy analysis - will be of immense importance. Emphasis will be on assessing the relationship between real and financial cycles and identifying the implications of financial factors for the economic fluctuations in the Macedonian economy. This topic has been particularly relevant since the outbreak of the global economic crisis, and undoubtedly, analyzing it will improve the recommendations of decision makers.\\nDistinguished guests,\\nIt is a great pleasure for us to partner with the central banks of Germany and Croatia in delivering such a large and significant project. I thank them for being part of this project and for supporting us in the process of European integration.\\nI also thank the central banks of Belgium, Lithuania, Portugal, Romania and the Netherlands who have also accepted to support our way towards European values. I believe in the not too distant future we will be partners not only in implementing projects, but also equal partners in the creation of European standards in central banking.\\nFinally, let us remember what Robert Schuman said in the 1950 Declaration, \"Europe will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan. It will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity.\" I hope that the achievements we make during the project delivery will reaffirm our readiness to be active and beneficial participants in the further construction of Europe.\\nThank you for your attention."

        "content": "Your Excellency Zhbogar,\\nDear Director General Simovski,\\nDear Mr. Nymand-Andersen,\\nEsteemed managers of regulatory institutions,\\nFormer Minister of Finance,\\nLadies and Gentlemen,\\nIt is my great pleasure to address you today at the celebration of the European Statistics Day.\\nReflecting on the concept of today's event for further affirmation of the importance of statistics, as well as our commitment to compile quality statistics under the latest European and international standards in general, I recall what Herbert George Wells said a century ago, \"Statistical thinking will one day be as necessary for efficient citizenship as the ability to read and write.\" And he was right. Today, when information and knowledge are the main building blocks of society, and when neither full information nor thorough knowledge is possible without quality data, there is no doubt that statistics are and will always be necessary, both for the individual and for the society at large. Therefore, the responsibility we all have as part of the statistical puzzle is great - we create a public good whose benefits are felt by every individual, every institution, policy maker ... all this for the benefit of a healthy and prosperous society.\\nThe past decade has witnessed tectonic changes in the global economic and financial landscape. These changes have also affected the central banks. With the onset of the crisis, the so-called conventional policies and instruments were reconsidered, the scope of our functions increased, and the expectations from us enhanced. Macroprudential function, bank resolution, consumer protection, financial inclusion and literacy are just some of the areas requiring from the central bank to play the leading role. \\nThe crisis itself and the subsequent changes to the overall central bank profile and decision-making infrastructure entail modifications in the scope, granularity, and the systematization of the available statistical data. A number of new statistical initiatives (such as the G-20 Data Gaps Initiative) aimed at enriching the statistical spectrum have emerged post crisis. The mere fact that global crisis arose exactly from the financial sector suggests that many of the post-crisis recommendations and needs for changes in the statistical system concern the central banks. The crisis has shown that excessive risk-taking can lead to a collapse of the financial system. Underestimation of the strength of the financial system's links with the real sector and the cross-border exposures has led to inadequate assessment of macro-financial links within some economies, as well as of the global implications of shocks in some countries. This whole new context, as well as the unconventional responses of central banks to this shock had major implications for the requirements for expansion and modification of the regular statistics, as the most important \"ingredient\" for making appropriate monetary as well as micro and macroprudential policy decisions.\\nThere is no doubt that as a central bank we have been actively following these global trends and updating our statistics to new dimensions for the last ten years. We have been compiling sectoral financial accounts as an important tool for better tracking of vulnerabilities in the economy, and the first public release is scheduled for 2020. Aware of the risks that may arise in segments of the financial system outside banks we have upgraded the statistics on deposit-taking institutions, with statistics on other financial institutions (pension funds, insurance companies, investment funds, leasing companies, financial companies). In the context of financial systems and markets, we were particularly focused on securities statistics, ensuring a better analytical infrastructure for timely risk detection. We have developed a broad and diverse database of financial stability indicators, and have been involved in the IMF reporting system on all key financial stability indicators, but also on some of the so-called \"recommended\" indicators.\\nHence, as a central bank, we have been constantly following international initiatives, enriching the statistical framework. Yet we must be aware that the enriched statistical framework also creates many new challenges. The increasing granularity of data and their frequency create an ecosystem with exponential growth in the volume and availability of data.\\nThe heterogeneity and complexity of the currently available data require a holistic approach to their transformation into official statistics. The main challenges for our as well as many other central banks relate to technology that processes enriched data volume, data governance, their standardization for statistical purposes, maintaining the confidentiality principle amid increasing number of individual data, as well as the balance between the growing need for data and the burden it imposes for the economic reporting agents.\\nTechnology is currently one of the major challenges for almost all statistical institutions. Data alone is not enough if there is no adequate infrastructure to transform it into a form beneficial for decision-making. One such step ahead of us is building a modern data warehouse. The need to adopt, integrate, process, and report large amounts of data to multiple users on a daily basis requires a modern business intelligence-based information system.\\nAdapting to such a technologically advanced system also requires data governance. Currently, there are several decentralized statistical databases, registries created for specific purposes of statistics and bank activities. The symbiosis of all these sources opens up a new chapter in the central bank - setup of systematized data governance. This process should focus on the need to recognize data as a central bank asset that should be governed at a strategic level. Learning from the experience of the European partners, the implementation requires a clear strategy, policy and guidance, as well as the need for standardization of data definitions, standards for data collection and management. In a word, there is a change in the organizational culture.\\nThe project of creating an Integrated Reporting System for statistical and supervisory purposes in the National Bank is such an example. Recognizing the need for unifying and replacing partial reporting systems by banks for statistical and supervisory purposes, we have worked diligently to set up a single multifunctional reporting system. The potential benefits for us and our partners - banks and savings houses, are immense - lower burden on the reporters, and a richer granular data set that can be used for multiple purposes, thus replacing the traditional way of submitting aggregates. As a reminder, one of the lessons learnt from the crisis is that aggregated data is not always sufficient to detect vulnerabilities in the system.\\nThe technological requirements, as well as the need for coordination and standardization are not processes that rest solely with the central bank. In the eve of meeting European statistical standards, communication and coordination among the statistical bodies is crucial. In our case, we are proud of the excellent coordination with our partners, the State Statistical Office and the Ministry of Finance, who are here with us today. A significant step forward will be the introduction of the so-called integrated coordination system for compiling government statistics, with real-time data available to all three institutions. This would ultimately mean more consistent fiscal, financial and macroeconomic statistics.\\nDespite the gravity of the global crisis, the process of innovation and digitization continued post crisis, widely spread in the financial industry. Such digitalization and innovation of financial services pose new challenges for their statistical monitoring and measurement. At the same time, there is a growing number of initiatives for active use of the so-called \"big data\" in the statistical world, a new paradigm that changes the profiles of both holders of statistics, statistical processes, and overall economic and financial analysis. Statisticians globally are increasingly experimenting with large structured and unstructured computer-generated data, the sources of which are all of us. The possibility of using this data as an innovative source of official statistics is being increasingly explored. The challenges are surely immense, given the need to assess the accuracy, sustainability and methodological foundations of these data systems, as well as the need to find human resources and appropriate management technologies.\\nLast but not least, there are investments for improving the dissemination and communication of statistics to the public. It is a recurring cycle in which we are constantly striving for better communication by conducting surveys of reporters and user satisfaction, regular publishing of statistical press releases- A new statistical web portal for external users - NBSat will be launched soon. This web portal will be a modern statistical tool designed for interactive communication with users, which will significantly expand their capabilities for data analysis of our central bank statistics.\\nConfirmation of our struggles to promote data dissemination is our adherence to the highest statistics dissemination standard of the International Monetary Fund - SDSS Plus early this year that made us one of the nineteen countries in the world whose statistics are harmonized with this highest statistical standard.\\nDear guests,\\nMany of the post-crisis statistics initiatives are completed both globally and in our country, or are underway. It is clear though that the environment is dynamic and requires constant changes in the data architecture of central banks. As Mario Draghi once pointed out, \"the well-established ESCB statistics will continue to provide the \"big picture\" of economic developments. But we should also offer a magnifying glass1\" to help us look at the details regularly and precisely. \"Looking at the details enriches our understanding of economic phenomena and at the same time increases our flexibility to respond to unexpected policy needs\".\\nI am sure that we, the statistical bodies, will always be ready to respond to the new challenges. Compiling and disseminating statistics in accordance with the latest European standards is and I believe will always be our strategic commitment. Today, the message from the father of statistics, Karl Pearson that \"Statistics is the grammar of science\" is more than clear. From today's perspective, I would add \"it is also a grammar of the language in which policy- and decision-makers need to speak and understand each other\".\\nThank you for your attention.\\n1 Draghi, M. Welcome address at the Eighth ECB Statistics Conference, Central Bank Statistics: moving beyond the aggregates, Frankfurt am Main, 6 July 2016.

        "title": "Stephen S Poloz: Release of the Monetary Policy Report",
        "content": "Good morning. Senior Deputy Governor Wilkins and I are pleased to be here to answer your questions about today's interest rate announcement and our Monetary Policy Report (MPR). Before turning to your questions, let me first offer some insight into Governing Council's deliberations.\\nNot surprisingly, the worsening global situation was the primary issue. Economic forecasts have been marked down further in most countries, largely as a consequence of the escalation of trade actions and uncertainty around what may be next. Heightened uncertainty about future trade policies is directly reducing business investment, and there is a risk that this will spread to households as well. These consequences can be buffered through easier monetary policy, and many central banks have recently eased in response. However, we need to remember that tariffs and trade restrictions will work over time to permanently reduce potential output everywhere, while raising the prices of consumer goods-a stagflationary scenario. Monetary policy can only do so much about these elements of the shock.\\nCanada is not immune to these global developments. In fact, Canada was one of the first countries to feel the effects of trade policy uncertainty, since NAFTA was the first target of the Trump administration. Indeed, this uncertainty has been weighing on investment in Canada for the past three years. These were important headwinds preventing Canadian interest rates from rising by as much as US rates did during 2017-18. Nevertheless, as other economies feel a growing impact from the trade war, there are second-round impacts on Canada through weaker exports and lower commodity prices.\\nIn today's updated projections, we are forecasting both exports and business investment to contract in the second half of this year and to recover only moderately in the next two years. We can see a wide range of indicators pointing to these effects-in manufacturing, mining and rail transportation-in our Business Outlook Survey and in the quarterly reports of bellwether global companies. While we have had these secondary effects in our forecast for some time, and increased them in our latest projection, these are mostly judgment-based, and the situation could worsen. Accordingly, we present a deeper analysis of this downside risk in today's MPR, in Box 3. Let me just note that the biggest effect for Canada of a more negative global growth scenario would be a steeper drop in commodity prices and, as in 2015, a significant depreciation of the Canadian dollar.\\nIn contrast to these adverse global developments, the Canadian economy is demonstrating resilience overall. The economy continues to create new jobs at a solid pace, the unemployment rate is near an all-time low, many companies are reporting an acute shortage of skilled workers, and wage growth is picking up noticeably in the past six months or so. The housing sector is clearly on the rebound, having digested the various housing policy changes put into place during 2016-18, and is still being fuelled by relatively high rates of immigration. Consumption spending has held up relatively well on average, supported by the solid labour market and low interest rates, even as the savings rate has been edging higher.\\nAt the same time, energy-producing regions continue to struggle, as the full adjustment to the decline in oil prices back in 2015 is not yet complete, and transportation constraints are making the situation worse. You may recall that back in 2015 we said that the full adjustment would take up to five years-that even with lower interest rates and a lower dollar, as well as fiscal stimulus, the adjustment to such a large shock takes a long time. It is painful for individuals, as it involves extended layoffs and possibly interprovincial migration, which is costly for all concerned.\\nAll this adds up to a complex outlook for Canada, with considerable variation across regions and sectors. The strong labour market points to sources of growth such as information technology and other professional services, tourism, education, health care and financial services. Some of this growth is being offset by negative effects coming through business investment and exports, particularly in manufacturing and the resource sector. On the whole, however, it appears that our economy is still operating close to capacity but probably with a modest amount of excess supply.\\nGoverning Council agreed that, all things considered, this excess supply is probably not pervasive. Furthermore, our situation differs from many other countries in that inflation is at our 2 percent target today and projected to remain very close to target, despite the presence of modest excess supply. However, we acknowledge the downside risks, as set out in our alternative scenario in Box 3.\\nGoverning Council also devoted some time to a discussion of the evolution of financial vulnerabilities in Canada. We have been encouraged by developments since the enhancement of the mortgage stress test, as there has been a significant decline in new mortgages above 450 percent of disposable income. Further, we have not seen evidence of froth in major housing markets for some time now. However, the recent strength in many housing markets across the country is a reminder that we will be carrying high levels of debt for a long time, despite a constructive evolution of vulnerabilities.\\nIt is with this context in mind that Governing Council considered whether the downside risks to the Canadian economy were sufficient at this time to warrant a more accommodative monetary policy as a form of insurance against those risks, and we concluded that they were not. In this setting, we discussed whether such insurance may come at a cost, in the form of higher financial vulnerabilities and possible consequences for the economy and inflation in the future. We agreed that the new mortgage rules in place limit this cost, but the situation will require continuous monitoring. Moreover, the fact that inflation has been on target and is projected to remain near target means that we can weigh the upside and downside risks to inflation more symmetrically.\\nGoverning Council is mindful that the resilience of Canada's economy will be increasingly tested as trade conflicts and uncertainty persist. In considering the appropriate path for monetary policy, we will be monitoring the extent to which the global slowdown spreads beyond manufacturing and investment. In this context, we will pay close attention to the sources of resilience in the Canadian economy, notably consumer spending and housing activity. We will also be watching for any changes to fiscal policy at the federal level now that the election is behind us.\\nWith that, Senior Deputy Governor Wilkins and I will now be happy to take your questions."

        "title": "Olli Rehn: Making the best out of second-best climate policies",
        "content": "Ladies and Gentlemen,\\nIt is a great pleasure to welcome all of you to this conference, organised jointly by the Bank of Finland and the Ministry of Finance. As Minister Mika Lintil\\xe4 just pointed out, promoting sustainable and green finance is one of the key priorities of the Finnish EU Presidency. Indeed, it has to be, as climate change is an existential threat to the future of our planet.\\nPeople sometimes think that climate change mitigation is difficult or a relatively new challenge. But I would argue that we have known most if not all the pieces of the puzzle for over 30 years, even though we have not yet been able to solve the puzzle. Now, let me explain why we should not wait for another 30 years before solving it.\\nIn 1987, the World Commission on Environment and Development - the so-called Brundtland Commission - released a report entitled Our Common Future. I am a proud owner of the first edition of that report, which highlighted that economic growth, ecological sustainability and social justice cannot be separated from each other, if we want to achieve sustainable development.\\nIn 2006, Lord Nicholas Stern, who is here with us today, released the landmark Stern Review that links climate change and economics. One of its central theses is that climate change is the largest market failure ever seen. Because CO2 emissions are an externality, market forces alone will not solve the problem without a global public policy.\\nWhile street demonstrations and citizen activism play an important role in pressing for more ambitious climate action, what we need in terms of public policy is consistent, systemic and rational policy solutions to achieve effective concrete results.\\nSystemic in the sense that they need to cover and bite in energy production, transport fuels and manufacturing industries widely. Rational in the sense that they need to lean on insights based on theory and evidence - \"In science we trust\". Economics can provide such insights on which policies actually work.\\nBased on economics and policy analysis, there are three essential and widely accepted requirements for an effective climate policy.\\nThe first is efficiency, which implies that we should design policy action so that we get the biggest emission reductions for a buck.\\nThe second requirement is that climate policy needs to be fair. The cost of transition needs to be evenly shared, and in such a way that also takes into account historical responsibility for emissions.\\nThirdly, the policy needs to address the free-rider problem by ensuring that everyone has an incentive to take part in the system. Since climate change is a truly global problem, it implies by definition that we need solutions that in the end have a global scope. Free-riding and carbon leakage would simply erode the work of even the best of students.\\nBased on these three requirements, the first-best solution to limiting CO2 emissions would be a global carbon tax. Many economists have expressed their support for such a solution.1\\nIn order to be effective, a global carbon tax would need to be complemented with a border carbon adjustment to avoid countries undermining the system by not signing up to it.\\nWhen theories are put into practice, however, policymakers face the complexity of the real world. The sense of urgency on climate action seems to vary from country to country across the global arena. Second-best solutions are therefore necessary as medium-term transitional measures, whether we like it or not. We have prominent regional and national initiatives, based on international treaties, in place that aim at effective climate change mitigation.\\nLadies and Gentlemen,\\nIn that spirit, the European Commission adopted an ambitious European climate and energy strategy first in 2008 and a revised one in 2013. Still today, they form the basis on which the Member States build their national climate policies.\\nLater on, as the Minister of Economic Affairs in 2015 to 2016, I had the honour to present to the Finnish Parliament the National Energy and Climate Strategy to 2030.2 Not only did this strategy implement the EU-level goals, in many cases it went far beyond them.\\nI will highlight only a few points from the strategy. The central target is that the share of renewable energy in end consumption would increase to 50%. The share of transport biofuels would rise to 30%, with the parallel aim of significantly increasing the usage of electric and gas-powered vehicles. By the end of 2029, coal would no longer be used for energy production in Finland.\\nOverall, this is the background for Finland as the EU Presidency aiming to move forward an ambitious global climate agenda.\\nThe new President-elect of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has promised to propose a European Green Deal within the first 100 days in office. It would include an extension of the Emissions Trading Scheme, a Carbon Border Tax and a Cohesion Fund to support those regions that are most vulnerable to the transition. Furthermore, the new Commission wants to set more ambitious climate targets for the EU for 2030.\\nSustainable finance is a critical area where the EU can support the transition. In addition to \"traditional\" EU funding that can be used to finance sustainable investments, the European Fund for Strategic Investments is an important source of such funding. The enhanced version of this Fund aims to mobilise over 500 billion euros by 2020, of which a significant part will be directed to sustainable investments.\\nOne cannot talk about green finance in Europe without mentioning the European Investment Bank (EIB). EIB President Werner Hoyer has recently indicated that the EIB, together with public and private partners, aims to unlock at least 1 trillion euros in sustainable investments by 2030. But we will likely hear more about the role of the EIB soon from its Vice President, Alexander Stubb.\\nLadies and Gentlemen,\\nEurope is currently the world's largest market for Green Bonds and loans linked to environmental, social and governance goals (ESG). These instruments will play a key role in helping the EU become climate-neutral by 2050 - or preferably much earlier.\\nOne of the first steps to enhance sustainable finance in the EU will be the completion of the EU Sustainable Finance Taxonomy. The Taxonomy is aimed at building a common definition of sustainability, and we will hear more about its importance later today.\\nBuilding on the Taxonomy, the EU should finalise its EU Green Bond Standard, which is already on its way. By harmonising the requirements, we can standardise verification, lower the costs of issuing bonds, and minimise the risk of green-washing.\\nThis should encourage more active participation, thus boosting the supply of projects that could be financed with Green Bonds. Similar treatment of other types of sustainable instruments should be considered. We will hear about the instruments in the last panel of today.\\nLadies and Gentlemen,\\nWhile the responsibility for climate policy lies with governments, central banks and financial supervisors are working actively to support progress.\\nClimate change creates two types of financial stability risks: physical risks resulting from extreme weather conditions and transition risks caused by the exit from carbon-intensive business models.\\nWith the help of the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), central banks and supervisors analyse climate risks and enhance the role of sustainable finance. The recent recommendations of the network provide a good basis for climate action by all central banks globally.\\nLastly, in order to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees, we need urgent measures. As noted earlier, we have known most if not all the pieces of this puzzle for at least 30 years. In the next 30 years, we must solve the puzzle. Not solving it would be an Epic Fail, really failing future generations.\\nLadies and Gentlemen, Dear Friends,\\nLet me now invite onto the stage Lord Nicholas Stern, who will give us his insights on the policies needed to achieve a sustainable future. Nicholas Stern is currently Professor of Economics and Government at the London School of Economics, and he has received several awards for his ground-breaking work on economics and climate change.\\nIn 2015, Nicholas Stern published a book entitled Why Are We Waiting? It looked at the progress since the Stern Review and found it had been too slow. Financial crises had led to some wavering in the wealthier countries.  \\nDespite this, the book provides a cautiously optimistic take. This is based on the idea that we still have many routes open. We have not painted ourselves into a corner and we can still choose the right way forward.\\nWithout further ado, Lord Stern, the floor is yours. And once more, welcome everybody!\\n1 https://www.econstatement.org/\\n2 The document can be found here: https://tem.fi/en/energy-and-climate-strategy-2016"

        "title": "Marja Nyk\\xe4nen: Problems in embedding climate risks into the traditional financial risk framework",
        "content": "Ladies and Gentlemen,\\nWelcome to the second day of the conference. I am glad to see such a broad spectrum of expertise here. I am Marja Nyk\\xe4nen, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Finland.\\nIn recent years, the Bank of Finland has become active in climate-related issues. For example, we participate in the work of the Network for Greening the Financial System's work streams and plenary.\\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) publishes reports on scenarios that will happen if we fail to lower our emissions. From the most recent special report, we learned that the Arctic and polar areas will experience considerable transformations as glaciers melt at an increasingly faster rate. The melting creates a massive amount of meltwater, which will have significant impact on rising sea levels. But the report shows that polar areas also face other consequences. Let's take, for example, the Arctic Ocean.\\nIt provides a habitat for many species. By 2100, it will freeze later in the year with thinner ice and leave those species without a sufficient habitat. Also by 2100, up to 80% of Scandinavian and Central European mountain glaciers might have vanished.  \\nFor me, such future prospects are unsettling.\\nEven though the scenarios seem worrying, it is not too late to act. We, as finance professionals, play an important role in this fight against climate change.\\nAs we heard yesterday, a significant amount of investment is required to transform our economies into sustainable ones. To facilitate investment, we need a well-functioning financial market with availability of green funding instruments. And, in order to ensure a well-functioning financial system, we must keep an eye on the system-level climate risks that might threaten the stable functioning of the financial system and smooth flows of funding for sustainable investments.\\nIn the discussion of climate change risks to the financial sector, two types of systemic risks have been identified. Firstly, there are physical risks, namely damage caused by extreme weather events or climate-related natural disasters. These include hurricanes, floods, storms, heat waves etc. In addition to potential risks to life, such events generate great financial damage.\\nFor example, such events may damage properties. If the property is insured, insurance companies will carry the loss. If the property is not insured, the owner of the property will have to pay for the damage. In the event that the property owner becomes insolvent or the collateral value of that property is lowered, credit institutions may also be at risk.\\nThe extent of physical risks is difficult to estimate in advance, but in extreme cases the potential losses may be significant. In addition, as the risk horizon is long, the frequency and severity of extreme weather events will change over decades. This makes it even harder to model physical risks in the traditional financial risk framework.\\nThe second recognised risk type is transition risk. Transition risk arises when carbon-intensive companies need to adjust their business models to become less carbon-intensive. The adjustments may be a consequence of changes in climate policy or consumer preferences, but they may result in rapid changes in company valuations. And, in extreme instances, in the valuations of entire industries. For companies that confront transition risk, the adjustment requires investments and the replacement of old technologies and production capacity. The big question is whether this transformation can be done smoothly or whether it becomes extremely costly and burdensome.\\nTransition risk may then manifest itself in investor portfolios, where such revaluations may force investors to book losses. Transition risk is an outcome of a complex process, which makes it even harder to estimate. Comparing physical and transition risks, it makes me wonder whether the actual climate or the climate policy is more difficult to predict. The more we delay effective climate policies, however, the quicker and the more powerful the policies will need to be in the future.\\nEvery financial institution needs to assess these climate-based risks and incorporate them into their risk management frameworks.\\nA related question is how financial supervisors and regulators should approach climate-based financial risks. What should we expect from financial institutions and how can we help them figure out what to do?\\nFirstly, it is important to identify best practices and to share experiences between supervisors and within the whole financial industry. The Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) offers a platform for considering the best practices to fight climate change in the financial sector. The network is global and it was founded in December 2017. Nowadays, the NGFS has 46 members and 9 observers. The observers include, for example, the IMF, the World Bank and the OECD.\\nLast April, the network published its first comprehensive report: A Call for Action. The report contains four recommendations for central banks and supervisors and two additional recommendations for policymakers to facilitate the work of central banks and supervisors.\\nThe recommendations for central banks and supervisors steer, for example, the assessment of climate-related financial risks in the financial system and the bridging of data gaps. The recommendations also encourage central bankers to lead by example in their own operations by integrating sustainability factors into own portfolio management.\\nAfter publishing the recommendations, the work of NGFS has continued to be active. The NGFS's work is divided into three different work streams, which are: Micro-prudential and supervision, Macro-financial, and Mainstreaming green finance. The work streams build analytical capacity within the member organisations and publish handbooks on best practices based on wide consultations of NGFS members and other relevant institutions.\\nJust a couple of weeks ago, in October 2019, the network published a report titled A Sustainable and Responsible Investment Guide for Central Banks' Portfolio Management. In this report, the NGFS provides further guidelines concerning the earlier published recommendation on integrating sustainability factors into own portfolio management and encourages central bankers to adopt Sustainable and Responsible Investment (SRI) practices into their own portfolio management.\\nThe major challenges in analysing risks and designing optimal policies are the lack of comprehensive and comparable data as well as the, as yet, inadequate modelling methods. While we already have a high volume of climate-related data, it has significant limitations. One of the main concerns is that climate-based risks are hard to identify from the historical data, as the impact of climate change may not yet show up in the data.\\nThough there might be a large number of data providers, there are many challenges associated with the data. Firstly, the data are expensive and data from different providers are not comparable. Secondly, company-level data vary due to different disclosure methods. Thirdly, the extent to which a business model is dependent on carbon-intensive suppliers hardly shows up in company-level reporting. Furthermore, it is difficult to relate the climate data to the financial data of the companies.\\nThe lack of adequate data and models cannot be a reason to do nothing, however. It is each financial company's own responsibility to develop their risk assessment methods. Collaboration and common understanding are needed to ensure that the analysis is fit and relevant for the purpose.\\nOnce we identify the best practices for risk assessment, we can then talk about which tools can be used to incentivise sustainable investing. Green Supporting Factors (GSF) and Brown Penalising Factors (BPF) have often been under discussion. In my opinion, unless we have a very good basis from a financial risk point of view for risk differentials between green and brown investments, we should not introduce changes to prudential rules just for the sake of incentivising certain types of investments.\\nBut if we need to choose between these two, then it should rather be the Brown Penalising Factors than the Green Supporting Factors. The basis for this is that climate change and climate policies do not show up in past data and therefore the risks stemming from them are not necessarily reflected properly in the risk calculations.\\nInstead of supporting or penalising certain types of investments, supervisory expectations would be a convenient way of guidance. Some supervisors, the Bank of England for example, have set out supervisory expectations for financial institutions on how they should manage climate risks. The supervisory expectations of the Bank of England cover governance frameworks, risk management, the use of scenario analysis and appropriate disclosure.\\nIn my opinion, risk management is the key element. To practise proper risk management, we need to figure out the best frameworks to identify and evaluate risks. We should also use some level of standardisation in the risk management framework for climate-based risks so that the outcomes are comparable between institutions. Adequate reporting and disclosure are also relevant. To achieve proper risk management, collaboration and discussion between institutions becomes important.\\nEveryone knows that climate-based financial risks are challenging and difficult to approach, as we haven't yet established a common framework. I hope we can lay a few building blocks for this framework today. I am very much looking forward to the panel on financial stability and the risks from climate change this afternoon.\\nI believe that by discussing and sharing experiences, we will be able to find the best approach to this challenging issue of fighting climate change without compromising financial stability. We just need to find the best practices and at the same time execute wise financial regulation to support the greening of the financial system.\\nNow, let's enjoy the second day of the conference; we have a very interesting keynote and two panels yet to come.\\nThank you!"

        "content": "\"I am a German and will remain a German, but I have always been a European too and have felt as such.\"\\nThese are the words spoken by Konrad Adenauer in 1946, when reconciling Europe and securing peace were paramount. National arrogance and isolationism had culminated in two world wars - two world wars which had wreaked death, misery and chaos on Europe.\\nAdenauer's conviction had a profound influence on many people, including my parents. His core belief that \"we're Europeans first and Germans second\" is still a great inspiration to me today. For those who lived through the Second World War, a strong Europe, a united Europe, represented the future and the path to lasting peace.\\nBut today some people harbour doubts about the European idea. Nationalism and populism are flaring up again and parties that are critical of the European project, or even reject it outright, are gaining ground in many countries.\\nThis is an alarming development."
